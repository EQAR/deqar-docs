The DEQAR administrative interface includes an interactive web form that allows to submit single reports. The administrative interface is available at:

<https://admin.deqar.eu/>
    
Your username is your agency's acronym (in lower case), your default password is the acronym followed by `#2018`.

The web form can be found in the menu under *Submit Report* > *[Report Form](https://admin.deqar.eu/report-form)*.

Required fields are marked with a <span style="color: #f00;">\*</span> in the form. The *Save Record* button will be active once all required information has been provided.

In several instances (Institutions, Programmes, Report Files) you are able to select/add one or more items. In those cases you will find form fields for one item on the left, followed by an *Add* button. On the right, you will see the item(s) selected/added, with buttons to remove or edit.

## Core Data

Please note that the *Activity* chosen might influence which information is required.

We strongly recommend that you provide a *Local Report Identifier* which identifies the specific report in your own information system or workflow. This will facilitate later updates should they be necessary.

## Institutions

A report needs to relate to one or more (e.g. in case of joint programmes) institution(s). You can add institutions using the search box or browse the full list by country.

## Programmes

The programme tab will only be active if your report belongs to an activity that is not a purely institutional type.

Fill the form with the required information and then click the *Add Programme* button. If the report concerns several programmes (e.g. clustered evaluation) please repeat the step for all programmes concerned.

## Report Files

Each report may contain one or more report files (for example, the experts' report, a possible summary report and the decision taken might be contained all in one or in separate files).

Files can be provided by link or directly uploaded. For each file, please specify the language(s) of the contents. The display name is optional; the text "Report" will be used as a default otherwise.
