CSV Upload Test
===============

A testing module is available to try the CSV upload under the following
address:

[https://backend.deqar.eu/csvtest/upload/]

The username is the agencyâ€™s acronym (in lower case, see reference list).
For the testing period, the password is the username followed by #2018.

After a successful login on the login page, a simple form is available to upload
the submission CSV files. Please refer to the Submission Template to create your
CSV files.

The uploaded CSV file goes through the same validation and flagging procedure as
the JSON package. Submission results are displayed directly in the browser,
under the submission form.
