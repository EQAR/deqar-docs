Structural Overview
-------------------
EQAR’s data model has been designed around four main entities: registered quality assurance **Agencies**, higher education **Institutions**, educational **Programmes** associated with institutions, and external quality assurance **Reports**.

While institutional information will largely be managed by EQAR based on data from ETER/OrgReg, registered agency users are invited to submit information on external quality assurance reports including information about the study programme concerned, if applicable. Further information on the type of information to be collected and stored in DEQAR can be found in the [Operational Model](https://eqar.eu/fileadmin/eqar_internal/MD/MD6/Database_of_External_QA_Results_Report_Model_v3.pdf), section 5.3, page 36.

DEQAR has also included a **Country** entity, which contains information on the official external quality assurance regime in each DEQAR-related country---a country which either hosts an EQAR-registered agency or hosts an institution evaluated by a EQAR-registered agency.

Functional Overview
-------------------
DEQAR supports three core activities:

- **Submission of data objects:** agencies submit objects and PDF files meeting defined criteria using one of three methods (individual records via webform; batch CSV file via webform; or as JSON via API).  
- **Administration of records:** data is ingested and records are created, stored and managed by EQAR staff and agencies over the longer term.
- **Search and discovery of information:** records are published on an public web interface for search, retrieval and export or download by end users.

Role of Standards and Identifers 
--------------------------------

When aggregating large amounts of data from different sources, the biggest challenges are:

1. To keep the same data from different sources in sync (ex., the same institution may be described slightly differently by different agencies),
2. To try to avoid duplication, and
3. To identify already existing records for update if necessary.

To achieve this, the DEQAR data model uses standard values on various levels. Countries are identifed via the ISO 3166-1 standard; language data is accepted in ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2/B format.

Entities are identifed in the following ways:

- **Agency:** As authentication is required before ingest and update of data and files, the agency is identifed automatically by the system. Nevertheless, an agency may serve as a "proxy agency" for a "creating agency", submitting and managing data on its behalf (as in case of umbrella organizations). In this case, the creating agency’s unique acronym or DEQAR agency ID must be provided as the source of identification.

- **Institution:** DEQAR is annually synced with the ETER/OrgReg register, so the frst line of identifcation will be the ETER ID. If an ETER ID is available, no further data on the institution is required.

For institutions not in ETER but already in the DEQAR, an internal DEQAR ID can be used.

If there is no ETER ID, DEQAR ID or the identifer does not produce a match, the
website address of the institution will be used as a second line of
identifcation and will be matched against the ETER list and data on already
submitted institutions. This failing, the name of the institution in English or
original language will be used. If the process produces no match with the ETER
list or with existing HEI data, then the record will be fagged for checking by
the EQAR secretariat. (If a record lacks an ETER ID, but a match is found among
the ETER registered institutions, then the ETER ID can be included in the
response.)

- **Programme:** DEQAR will not sync data on programmes; however if a local or national identifer is provided, this will be saved and can serve as a primary identifer if further reports are submitted for the same programme later.

- **Report:** Each report will receive an identifer generated by the DEQAR system. If an agency uses a local identifer for its reports, then this will be saved and can serve as the primary identifer for the purpose of resubmission.

DEQAR highly recommends the submission of local identifers for each submitted entity. These may come in handy when data must be updated via any of the batch
interfaces.

Use of Data from ETER/OrgReg
----------------------------

Historical Data
---------------

In the case of Agencies and Institutions, the system should record important
changes in the status of these entities (ex. name changes, changed activity or
status, physical relocation, etc.). Thus it is necessary to differentiate
between updates in data due to typographical or syntax errors, and
“substantial” updates, which will becomemight be considered as part of
an historic data trail. On web forms and on the submission API endpoints there
will be a possibility to indicate a change request. In this case, the
overwritten data will be stored as historical data (and can be queried). It
remains unclear whether the bulk ingest and CSV upload can support this feature;
it is under discussion.
