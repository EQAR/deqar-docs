Registered agency users are invited to submit and manage information on their external quality assurance reports, including information about the particular study programme described in the report, if applicable. On the other hand, institutional information is managed by the EQAR secretariat, largely based on data from ETER/OrgReg. EQAR will also continue to collect and manage agency data as well as country data through their registry. These will be linked to report and institution data in DEQAR. To support this, DEQAR also includes a Country entity, which contains information on the official external quality assurance regime in any country which hosts an institution evaluated by an EQAR-registered agency. Functional Overview \u00b6 DEQAR supports three core activities: Submission of data objects: agencies submit objects and PDF files meeting defined criteria using one of three methods as individual records via webform as batch CSV file via webform as JSON using an API Administration of records: data is ingested and records are created, stored and managed by EQAR staff and agencies over the longer term. Agencies may update report records already in the system and track their own activity. Search and discovery of information: records are published on an public web interface for search, retrieval and export or download by end users. There is also a public API available to all registered users; this allows users to embed DEQAR search interface in their local site. Role of Standards and Identifiers \u00b6 As DEQAR aggregates data from different sources, we face several challenges: To keep the same data from different sources synchronised (e.g. the same institution may be described differently by different agencies), To try to avoid duplication, and To identify already existing records for update if necessary. DEQAR uses a set of standard identifiers which are provided by the system for each entity. In several cases, we also allow agencies to provide their local or national identifiers for entities in order to ease their internal workflows. Entities are identified in the following ways: Entity Recommended Identification Alternative Identification Agency DEQAR Agency ID agency acronym Activity DEQAR Activity ID activity local identifier, activity name Reports local report identifier DEQAR Report ID Institution DEQARINST ID ETER ID, local institution identifier, other institution identifier Programme local programme identifier As a rule, entities already in the system should be identified to facilitate linking up. In other words: The agency responsible for the report and the activity to which it belongs must be identified with any submission . An identifier must be provided for each institution covered by the report. If institution records do not yet exist in DEQAR, information on the institutions must be provided separately before reports can be submitted. In the case of reports and programmes , agencies are encouraged to provide local identifiers with each new submission of data in order to facilitate subsequent linking: For reports, the agency can provide a local identifier with each new report submitted; the local identifier may be used to later update the report using CSV or JSON and may also help each agency to synchronise its local system with DEQAR. For programmes, the first time an agency provides information on a programme to DEQAR, a local (or national) identifier can be submitted along with data on the programme; the identifier can later be used by the agency for any report on the same programme. The identification of each entity type is explained in detail below. Agency Identifiers \u00b6 Authentication is required before the submission and update of data and files. Thus, the agency responsible for each report can be identified automatically by the system. In some cases, an agency may serve as a proxy agency for a creating agency , submitting and managing data on its behalf (as in the case of umbrella organisations). In this case, the creating agency\u2019s unique acronym or DEQAR Agency ID (which can be found in the administrative interface) must be provided as the source of identification. For this reason, identification of the creating agency is required for each object when using CSV and JSON. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Agency .) Activity Identifiers \u00b6 DEQAR also assigns IDs to each agency's activities (see list on the agency's public register entry under Activities within the scope of ESG ). These identifiers, which can be found through the administrative interface, should be used to indicate the type of report in each CSV or JSON object. Alternatively, the exact name of the activity can be used or an agency may wish to use its own local activity identifiers; in this case, the agency should supply through their local identifiers through the administrative interface before using them for submission. Note: Only one identifier should be provided for the assigned activity. Please note that any changes to the agency's activities, other than purely editorial or technical changes, must be made through Substantive Change Reports . (See Submission Object Data Elements: Activity .) Report Identifiers \u00b6 We strongly recommend that agencies provide a local identifier with each report submitted. This will allow for subsequent updates to the record and will ease synchronisation with each agency's local system. Report local identifiers will be stored and can serve to identify records for update/resubmission. DEQAR will also automatically generate a DEQAR ID for each newly submitted report; this will be returned to agencies as part of the response object. The DEQAR ID can be used for updates/resubmission as an alternative to local identifiers. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Report Identifier .) Institution Identifiers \u00b6 Institutions already described in DEQAR should be identified in report submissions using one of several identifiers. This allows the system to automatically link report data to existing institution records. DEQARINST IDs : DEQAR automatically generates a so-called \"DEQARINST ID\" for each institution record that is created in the system. These can be found through the administrative interface. (They are also returned to the agency as part of the response object after each successful submission.) Ideally, each registered agency will store the DEQARINST IDs for institutions treated in their reports. These are recommended for use in each submission. ETER IDs : DEQAR harvests records from the ETER/OrgReg database once a year. These records are the source of many of the institution records in DEQAR. The ETER ID for these institutions can be found through the administrative interface. The ETER IDs may be stored and used by agencies for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs. Local identifiers : Agencies may also create and store local identifiers for institutions. These can be used for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs if supplied in advance. Each agency can provide these individually through the administrative interface or these can provided in bulk to the EQAR Secretariat. Local identifiers are managed by one agency independently and can only be used by that agency. Other identifiers : DEQAR allows to store additional national, European or other identifiers. These can be used for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs and are available to all agencies; other identifiers available in the system can be consulted through the administrative interface. In order to ensure uniqueness and stability these are managed by the EQAR secretariat, but agencies are invited to provide identifiers to EQAR that might be useful to other agencies. Other identifiers are always used in combination with a resource indication, in combination with which they are unique. Note: agencies should provide a single identifier; if more than one is provided, the DEQARINST ID will be used to establish the linkage. If an agency cannot locate an existing institution record in DEQAR (and therefore cannot provide either the DEQARINST ID, ETER ID or local identifier), then it will need to provide institution data separately before being able to submit reports on that institution. (See Institution Data and Submission Object Data Elements: Institution(s) .) Programme Identifiers \u00b6 DEQAR will not synchronise data on programmes; however, if a local or national identifier is provided at the time of submission, this will be stored in the system. The agency can use the programme identifier if it would like to simply re-use the existing programme data for subsequent reports. It is thus recommended to provide a unique programme identifier if available. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Programme Identification .) Other Identifiers and Codes \u00b6 Countries are identified via the ISO 3166-1 standard . Language data is accepted in ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2/B format . Finally, DEQAR provides DEQAR IDs for standard values used for Report Status and Report Decision . These can be provided instead of the equivalent string values in CSV or JSON objects. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Report Details .) Building Institution Records \u00b6 DEQAR has two basic workflows for creating institution records. Either records are harvested from the ETER/OrgReg databases (available through Research infrastructure for research and innovation policy studies - RISIS or European Tertiary Education Register - ETER ; or, if no record exists in ETER/OrgReg, a new institution record is created from scratch based on data submitted by an agency. Use of Data from ETER/OrgReg \u00b6 DEQAR harvests records from ETER/OrgReg on an annual basis. These records serve as base set of records on European higher education institutions in DEQAR. DEQAR stores the following ETER data on institutions: ETER ID official name English name acronym country city (when available) latitude/longitude (when available) QF-EHEA levels institution website ETER/OrgReg data is managed according to the following principles: As a general policy, DEQAR keeps ETER data stable and unchanged between harvests. If an agency would like to propose a correction or change of ETER data, the EQAR secretariat should be contacted. Alternative names and local identifiers may be added to ETER records and managed by agencies through the administrative interface (see Institution Identifiers above). The EQAR secretariat reserves the right to adapt ETER records based on the information that we receive through agencies and other sources. Added information and updates are carried through to records from subsequent harvests. Institutions Not in ETER/OrgReg \u00b6 For data not existing in ETER/OrgReg, a new record must be created based on data submitted by an agency. In order to ensure data quality and avoid record duplication institution data is always manually screened by EQAR staff and thus needs to be submitted separately and before reports are uploaded for an institution. The minimum data needed to create a record is: name official, country of institution and website (the URL of domain). Institution data created based on information by agencies is managed according to similar principles as data harvested from ETER/OrgReg: As a general policy, DEQAR keeps institution data, including that submitted directly by an agency, stable and unchanged. If an agency would like to propose a correction or change of existing institution data, the EQAR secretariat should be contacted. Alternative names and local identifiers may be added to any institution record and managed by agencies through the administrative interface (see Institution Identifiers above). The EQAR secretariat reserves the right to adapt records based on the information that we receive through agencies and other sources. (See Institution Data Elements .) Hierarchical and Historical Institutional Relationships \u00b6 In those cases that quality assurance reports are produced for different organisational levels of an institution , DEQAR collects and stores data on both entities and establishes a hierarchical link between them. This may be the case of an institution and its \"child\" faculties or of an institution and its \"parent\" institution group. DEQAR bases its hierarchical links on information taken from ETER/OrgReg. If any agency would like to propose an additional structural link between two or more institutions or institutional levels, then the proposed link can be provided individually or in a longer list to the EQAR secretariat. In the public search interface, quality assurance reports produced for different levels in the same institution will cascade -- i.e. records on child institutions will include the reports produced on the parents; records on parent institutions will show the reports produced on its children. DEQAR will also store information on historical changes in the structure of institutions, e.g. mergers, splits, spin offs and absorptions . This will allow users to view historical records in the correct context. It will also facilitate the search and discovery of current institutions. Note: historical changes in the structure of agencies will also be stored and presented online. Presenting Historical Data \u00b6 DEQAR not only presents information on the recent ESG-compliant quality assurance activities performed on institutions across Europe and beyond, but also records an historical \"trail\" of the these activities since 2008, a date which marked the launch of EQAR. Thus DEQAR stores both current and past valid reports on each institution and both are presented to end users through the search interface. Historical data is especially important for DEQAR users from recognition offices or information centres. Preferably, agencies should thus upload information on all external QA procedures that were completed during their registration period, including those reports that are already \"expired\". Agencies should at least upload information on all external QA reports that are still valid. DEQAR also captures historical changes in the status and profile of agencies and institutions e.g. name changes, changed activity, physical relocation and changes in the institutional structure (see Hierarchical and Historical Institutional Relationships ). Changes in the quality assurance regulations within EQAR countries are also captured. To this end, DEQAR differentiates between updates in data due to typographical or syntax errors, and \u201csubstantial\u201d updates considered part of the historical data trail. Historical data will be part of the search domain and can therefore be queried by end users. Any request for an update to an institution record to record historical changes of this sort may be submitted to the EQAR secretariat for review. (It is part of the daily work of the EQAR secretariat to keep the registry of agencies and countries complete and up to date. Changes to the agency's activities, other than purely editorial or technical changes, must be made through Substantive Change Reports . Nevertheless, in case there is a concern about the recorded status, location or activities of a specific agency or of the quality assurance regime in a particular country, questions can also be directed to the EQAR secretariat.)","title":"Architecture and Data Model"},{"location":"architecture_data_model/#architecture-and-data-model","text":"","title":"Architecture and Data Model"},{"location":"architecture_data_model/#structural-overview","text":"The DEQAR data model has been designed around four main entities: registered quality assurance Agencies , higher education Institutions , educational Programmes associated with institutions, and external quality assurance Reports .

Prepare your data with guidance on the Report Data Elements above. Submit data using your chosen submission method. Await data ingest via the Data Pipeline and receive response object with possible further instructions. Choosing a Submission Method \u00b6 Considering the various needs of the agencies, DEQAR supports three different submission methods. Their use is highly dependent on the technical resources available to a particular agency. Importantly, all three methods are fully interoperable. That is, agencies may switch between different methods at any time, and data submitted via one method may be updated/altered via another method. Webform : Those agencies needing a simple means of submitting report data to DEQAR can enter data directly in the webform present in the administrative interface. This method is fully manual; agencies can simply login and create new report records or modify existing ones. Flags and validation errors will be returned immediately upon submission. Data already submitted using CSV or JSON/API will also be accessible through the administrative interface. We recommend this method for agencies: without IT developers with a closed system architecture from which data export is not straightforward who would like to submit small amounts of data occasionally who would like to interact with their DEQAR data directly CSV Upload : In order to submit batches of documents, agencies may prefer to work with well-established formats like Excel. Comma Separated Values (CSV) is a flat file format which can be produced and presented directly through Excel, LibreOffce and many other software packages. Since CSV is a flat format (a single records or object per row), there is some redundancy in the data collected. Thus, this is termed a semi-automatic data submission method. DEQAR has provided a submission file template which can be complemented with the detailed explanation of the data elements above (see Report Data Elements ). Using CSV, transformation of data can be done manually by administrative staff without the help of IT. Staff can then login to the administrative interface and upload the CSV file, staging it for import. When the upload is complete, records (i.e. single lines of the file) are validated and information on the status of each record in the uploaded batch are shown on the import interface. Agency staff can then decide to ingest the valid records or revert the entire batch, correcting the data in the CSV file and re-uploading it for import. We recommend this method for agencies: without IT developers with a local system from which they can export data in tables who would like to submit bigger amounts of data in a batch who would like to work manually on their data before submitting to DEQAR Submission API : REST API is a convenient way for software developers to communicate via HTTP, the protocol used by the internet. When used together with the JSON format it provides fexible means of exchanging data between systems. With the possibility of sending complex request and response objects, DEQAR can accept structured data and give immediate feedbacks (error checks, warnings) about the submitted data as well as metadata enhancements. We recommend this method for agencies: with IT developers / IT vendors who can develop a method (script/web application) to post data to the API endpoint who would like to submit large amounts of data at once with a single call who would like to submit individual reports immediately upon their creation who would like to keep DEQAR and their local system in sync who plan to submit data periodically and at longer intervals (e.g. weekly or monthly). Data Pipeline \u00b6 In general, irrespective of the submission method, all data submitted to DEQAR is handled following these steps: The submission object goes through the first level of validation. If the data format is invalid or the submitted identifiers cannot be resolved, the record is rejected (see Validation Criteria below). Valid report data is populated in the appropriate tables. Sanity checks are run against pre-defined flagging criteria; reports which contain conflicts are flagged (see Flagging Criteria below). A Response Object (or array of objects) is sent back to the agency, containing: detailed error descriptions for objects that were rejected identifiers of records that were created or identified (in the case of Institutions) identifiers for newly created records (Reports, Report Files) information on records where sanity checks found errors. Validation criteria \u00b6 In order for submission objects to clear the first level of validation, they must meet the following criteria: The agency that created the report (which may or may not be the agency submitting the records) must be clearly identified. The agency may be identified using an agreed upon acronym or a DEQAR agency ID which has been provided by the EQAR secretariat. All required data must be present for each report. Required data for all records includes: ESG activity performed : provided as activity name, ID given by EQAR or as a local identifier. Status of report , provided as text or as an ID Decision , provided as text or as an ID. Report valid from date, including date format used by the agency Language(s) of the report: At least one language for each report should be provided as a two- or three-digit ISO 639-1 or 2/B code . Ideally language information is provided along with the link to the location of the PDF file. Institution: a report must relate to at least one institution, either an existing DEQAR institution record identified by DEQARINST ID, ETER ID or Agency Local Identifier, or a new institution record . The identified/created Institution's DEQARINST and ETER IDs are returned as part of the Response Object for each submission. For reports on programmes, the programme name (in whatever language it is stored by the Agency). At this point, dependencies between elements will be checked as well as any limits on the number of values permitted for each element. Submitted data must be of the correct type, form and value range/options as described above. Submitted data must align with the Agency Profile information, specifically report validation date should fall after Agency EQAR registration dates and activities should match defined ESG activities for the Agency. Submitted data must meet basic data integrity rules for the system, i.e. there should be one and only one creating agency and at least one institution covered by each report. Submitted report data must meet the structural requirements determined by the ESG activity . Records not meeting all of the above criteria will be rejected. The system will return a response object that clearly identifies rejected records, including information on the source of the problem. Importantly, the rejection of one or more submission objects does not imply the failure of the whole submission batch. Flagging criteria \u00b6 Once the submission objects clear the first level of validation, they are officially ingested into the system. DEQAR records are populated with valid data and final sanity checks are run on the records. At this stage, DEQAR records may receive either a \u201clow-level flag\u201d or a \u201chigh-level flag\u201d. In the first case, records will appear online with submitted data, while the EQAR Secretariat is informed to take note. In the second case, records will not be published until they have been checked and confirmed by the EQAR Secretariat. The purpose of a flag is to bring a report to the EQAR Secretariat's attention. A flag normally does not indicate that data should be changed. Therefore, provided that the data you entered/uploaded is correct, please do not try to change the data of a report in order to prevent it from being flagged. Simply wait for EQAR staff to have checked the report. Sanity checks may result in high-level flags for the following reasons: Report Status is listed as part of obligatory EQA system in a country where the Agency does not have official status according to EQAR's information. Defined QF-EHEA levels of an institution and one or more of its programmes do not match. Sanity checks may result in low-level flags for the following reasons: Report is on an institution in a country in which the agency has not previously been active. Validity From date of a report is more than one year before the submission date. (NB: this check is suspended during the uploading of legacy data from each agency.) Country of the Institution does not match the country of one or more of its programmes. Report on an Institution in the EHEA is submitted without the QF-EHEA levels provided. Note: any record awaiting harvest or upload of the PDF version of the related report will automatically receive a low-level flag until the report is successfully harvested/uploaded. Webform \u00b6 The DEQAR administrative interface includes an interactive webform, allowing you to submit single reports. The administrative interface is available at: location: https://admin.deqar.eu/ username: [agency's acronym (in lower case)] password: [your personal password] If you do not remember your password or did not change the default password, please go to https://admin.deqar.eu/forgot-password in order to reset your password. You need to enter your email address and will receive by email a special link that allows you to set a new password. The email address linked to your login is the same email address to which submission report emails are sent. If you do not remember which email address is linked to your agency's login, please contact the EQAR Secretariat. The webform can be found in the menu under Submit Report > Report Form . Required fields are marked with a * in the form; fields marked with a (*) are conditionally required. Please note that the Activity chosen might influence which information is required (see Report Data Elements above). The Save Record button becomes active once all required information has been provided. We strongly recommend that you provide a Local Report Identifier that identifies the specific report in your own information system or workflow, even when you use the webform. This will facilitate later updates should they be necessary, and can be useful if your agency changes to CSV upload or the Submission API later on. You can select institutions using the search box. If you are uploading a report on an institution that has no DEQAR record yet, see Institution Data on how to add it before uploading reports. Data on programmes will only be needed if your report results from a programme-level activity. Fill the form with the required information and then click the Add Programme button. If the report concerns several programmes (e.g. clustered evaluation) please repeat the step for all programmes concerned. (See Programme Data Elements above.) Each report may contain one or more report files (for example, the experts' report, a possible summary report and the decision taken might be contained all in one or in separate files). The report file fields are conditionally required. At least one must be present, but agencies can either provide a URL or upload a file directly (in either case, only PDF files are accepted). For each file, please specify the language(s) of its contents. The display name is optional; the text \"Report\" will be used as a default otherwise. (See QA Report Files above.) CSV Upload \u00b6 Comma-separated values (CSV) is a common and interoperable data-exchange format. Files can be imported and exported from all usual spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel, LibreOffice, ...) and numerous other applications. The first row of your file is a header which should include column names as defined under Report Data Elements above. The following lines contain one report per row. A simple example of a CSV first-fow header for institution-level reports could look as follows: agency, activity, status, decision, valid_from, valid_to, date_format, file[1].original_location, file[1].report_language[1], institution[1].eter_id (Spaces added for readability, these should not appear in an actual file.) One report may often include/relate to several items, such as one or more institution(s), programmes or one or more files--some in several languages. In those cases you will find field names of the type field_name[n] (See Report Data Elements above). You should create as many columns as you need and replace n by 1, 2, ... For example, two files (e.g. full report in local language, and summary in both English and local language) can be provided as follows: ..., file[1].original_location, file[1].display_name, file[1].report_language[1], file[2].original_location, file[2].display_name, file[2].report_language[1], file[2].report_language[1], ... ..., \"http://some.url/to/report\", \"Expert report\", \"de\", \"http://some.url/to/report\", \"Summary\", \"en\", \"de\", ... (Spaces added for readability, these should not appear in an actual file.) You can use one of the sample CSV files below as a starting point and adjust it to your needs. Please bear in mind the following: The template file is provided in Microsoft Excel and Open Document Formats, as well as viewable on-line. It needs to be saved in CSV format for upload to DEQAR (see notes below). The first worksheet includes all possible column names you could use in a CSV file, with the respective requirement/validation notes as comments. These comments will disappear as you save the file in CSV format. The subsequent worksheets include more condensed examples with sample data, including those columns that will typically be used in reports concerning institutions, programmes or joint programmes. You need to include all columns you might need in at least one of your reports, but they can stay empty in those lines where they are not applicable. You may omit columns from the sample CSV file that are not used in any of the reports. Template and samples \u00b6 Microsoft Excel format Open Document Format (OpenOffice/LibreOffice/NeoOffice) Sample in CSV format (without comments) Preparing/exporting CSV files \u00b6 Despite being software-independent, there are some known issues when creating/exporting CSV files from some major office applications. Given that it has the most clean and straight-forward CSV export, we recommend the LibreOffice package , a free and open-source desktop application supported on all major operating systems. For all software packages, please note that CSV format does not support multiple sheets, but it will always be only the current work sheet that is saved in CSV format. Microsoft Excel \u00b6 Despite offering CSV as a target file type in its Save as dialogue, Microsoft Excel does not create correct CSV files when certain character sets are used (e.g. Greek or Cyrillic alphabets, or certain Roman characters with diacritics). You can use the following work-around: Select Save as from the File menu, select your desired folder and choose Unicode Text (*.txt) as type. Simply press OK in response to the following error message: Furthermore, confirm with Yes also the following warning message: Close Microsoft Excel and navigate to the folder containing your file in the file manager. Right-click on your file and choose Rename . Now change the file extension from .txt into .csv . You will encounter the following message: If you change file name extension, the file may become unusable. You still want to change them, you should press \u2018Yes\u2019... Confirm the warning by clicking Yes. This CSV file is now suitable for upload. LibreOffice/OpenOffice/NeoOffice \u00b6 Exporting CSV files is straight-forward in LibreOffice, OpenOffice and NeoOffice: Choose Text CSV (*.csv) as file type in the Save As ... or Save a Copy ... dialogue: Ensure the export settings are set as follows in the next dialogue. Please pay particular attention character set and delimiters: The CSV file is now suitable for upload. Google Sheets \u00b6 In Google Sheets, choose Comma-separated values from the File > Download as... menu. Uploading CSV files \u00b6 The CSV upload module is part of the DEQAR admin interface: location: https://admin.deqar.eu/upload-csv username: [agency's acronym (in lower case)] password: [your personal password] (see above how to reset your password) Select Submit Report > Upload CSV from the menu. Choose your file under Select CSV file and click Upload . You can now review your data one more time under Uploaded CSV Data , and make changes if necessary. Afterwards, click on Ingest under the table. The uploaded CSV file now passes the same validation pipeline as information submitted through any other method. After ingest, you will see all rows highlighted in green if they were succesfully injected, or in red if they could not be ingested due to validation errors. Click on one row to see details about errors or flags in the top-right corner. If you experienced errors, you can correct the respective lines and click on Ingest again. Please note that the green rows will be re-ingested, but overwrite the existing report based on the DEQAR Report ID. Any changes you make to green rows will therefore be recorded on further ingest. Submission API \u00b6 REST API is a convenient way for software developers to communicate with web services via HTTP, the protocol used by the internet. Together with JSON it provides an easy, straightforward and flexible means of exchanging data between systems. With the possibility of sending complex request and response objects, we can accept structured data and give immediate feedbacks (e.g. error checks, warnings) about the submitted data as well as metadata enhancements (e.g. ETER IDs on HEIs, when applicable; links to new records on the EQAR public interface, etc.). Authentication \u00b6 Requests for submission to DEQAR are only accepted from registered users and must therefore be identified. DEQAR API endpoints manage authentication using API Tokens (through the so-called Bearer Authentication method). Upon registration, an API Token (which is basically a hash) is created for each user. Sending this token in the Authorization header (with type/scheme Bearer) will authenticate the user in place of a regular username and password. To get your authentication token you can send a POST request to the following URL: https://backend.deqar.eu/accounts/get_token/ An example of obtaining a token using curl in command line: curl -s -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -XPOST https://backend.deqar.eu/accounts/get_token/ --data '{\"username\":\"testuser\",\"password\":\"testpassword\"}' The username is the agency\u2019s acronym (in lower case). Please see above how to reset your password. Or for those who prefer to use the more user friendly HTTPie client: http POST https://backend.deqar.eu/accounts/get_token/ 'username=testuser' 'password=testpassword' You should send this token, preceded by the word Bearer , in the Authorization header with every further request. An example of a submission using curl or HTTPie: curl -s -H \"Content-type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Bearer $DEQAR_TOKEN\" -XPOST https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report --data-binary @$DEQAR_FILE http -v POST https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report \"Authorization: Bearer $DEQAR_TOKEN\" \"Content-type: application/json\" < $DEQAR_FILE Report Submission Endpoint \u00b6 The address of the submission endpoint is: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report This is the URL that you can use to make a POST request including the Submission Request Object as JSON object, or many objects as JSON array of objects in the request body. The Submission Request Object is the JSON object (or array of objects) which is the manifestation of a report or set of reports an agency wants to submit. Fields and accepted types are as described in Report Data Elements above. The full definition of request and response objects can be find in OpenAPI format under: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/swagger/ Important: Please do not include institution data (such as name, location, etc.) in your Submission Request Object. The corresponding fields are deprecated and will be removed in version 2 of the Submission API. Identify institutions by one single identifier only (DEQARINST ID, ETER ID, local or other identifier). New institutions must be added separately beforehand . Report File Submission Endpoint \u00b6 Files (PDF versions of reports) can be submitted in two separate ways: URLs submitted with a Submission Request Object will be harvested asynchronously upon successful submission. Files can be submitted directly to a dedicated endpoint as part of a PUT request: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/reportfile/<report_file_id>/<filename> report_file_id : The id number of the Report File object available in the response after successful submission. The report_file_id is contained in the response object of the successful report submission. filename : The name of the file that you will submit in this request. Examples \u00b6 The examples below show how a JSON Submission Request Object might look for different types of reports: Institutional report \u00b6 [ { \"agency\": \"MusiQuE\", \"local_identifier\": \"CRDB-October14\", \"activity\": \"183\", \"status\": \"part of obligatory EQA system\", \"decision\": \"positive\", \"valid_from\": \"2016-10-28\", \"valid_to\": \"2018-01-15\", \"date_format\": \"%Y-%m-%d\", \"report_files\": [ { \"original_location\": \"http://www.musique-qe.eu/userfiles/File/2014-10-bruxelles-website.pdf\", \"display_name\": \"Evaluation report\", \"report_language\": [ \"fr\" ] } ], \"institutions\": [ { \"eter_id\": \"BE0035\" } ] }, { \"agency\": \"MusiQuE\", \"local_identifier\": \"ENH-4711\", \"activity\": \"97\", \"status\": \"2\", \"decision\": \"4\", \"valid_from\": \"2021-01-15\", \"date_format\": \"%Y-%m-%d\", \"report_files\": [ { \"original_location\": \"http://www.musique-qe.eu/userfiles/File/2015-06-25-hamu-review-reportfinal.pdf\", \"display_name\": \"Institutional Review\", \"report_language\": [ \"eng\" ] }, { \"original_location\": \"https://zenodo.org/record/4516653/files/Database_of_External_QA_Results_Report%2BModel_2016.pdf?download=1\", \"display_name\": \"Addendum to the report\", \"report_language\": [ \"ger\" ] } ], \"institutions\": [ { \"deqar_id\": \"DEQARINST0390\" }, { \"eter_id\": \"AT0006\" } ] } ] Programme report \u00b6 { \"agency\": \"MusiQuE\", \"local_identifier\": \"SHM-April09\", \"activity\": \"181\", \"status\": \"2\", \"decision\": \"1\", \"valid_from\": \"2017-04-09\", \"valid_to\": \"2022-02-15\", \"date_format\": \"%Y-%m-%d\", \"report_files\": [ { \"original_location\": \"http://www.musique-qe.eu/userfiles/File/2009-06-report-trossingen-website.pdf\", \"display_name\": \"Review report\", \"report_language\": [ \"ger\" ] } ], \"institutions\": [ { \"eter_id\": \"DE0140\" } ], \"programmes\": [ { \"identifiers\": [ { \"identifier\": \"16\" } ], \"name_primary\": \"Organ Expert\", \"qualification_primary\": \"Master of Arts\", \"nqf_level\": \"level 7\", \"qf_ehea_level\": \"second cycle\" } ] } Joint Programme report \u00b6 { \"agency\": \"MusiQuE\", \"local_identifier\": \"EAMT-September13\", \"activity\": \"182\", \"status\": \"voluntary\", \"decision\": \"positive\", \"valid_from\": \"15.01.2020\", \"valid_to\": \"15.01.2025\", \"date_format\": \"%d.%m.%Y\", \"report_files\": [ { \"original_location\": \"http://www.musique-qe.eu/userfiles/File/final-reportaec-programme-reviewcopeco.pdf\", \"display_name\": \"Review report\", \"report_language\": [ \"eng\" ] } ], \"institutions\": [ { \"eter_id\": \"EE0022\" }, { \"eter_id\": \"SE0037\" }, { \"identifiers\": [ { \"identifier\": \"F LYON24\", \"resource\": \"Erasmus\" } ] }, { \"deqar_id\": \"DEQARINST0460\" } ], \"programmes\": [ { \"identifiers\": [ { \"identifier\": \"18\" } ], \"name_primary\": \"CoPeCo \u2013 Contemporary Performance and Composition\", \"qualification_primary\": \"Master (no joint degree)\", \"nqf_level\": \"level 6\", \"qf_ehea_level\": \"second cycle\" } ] } Updating Reports \u00b6 Normally, once a QA report has been published it will not change. Changing or updating reports in DEQAR should therefore be the exception, rather than regular practice. Reports can, however, be changed if needed as follows: Manually via admin interface Please find the report that you want to change in the admin interface, under under Reference data > Reports. To narrow down the search, use filters and search by report number, name, year, agency, country, activity type and flag. Once you find the report, open the record and click on Edit Report. When submitting, please leave a short note to explain the changes you made. Submission API or CSV Upload Please use the same method/template as for initially uploading reports. Use either the DEQAR Report ID ( report_id ) or the same Local Report Identifier ( local_identifier ) that you provided to DEQAR with your earlier/initial upload of the report. Lacking an ID prevents the system from recognising the report that needs to be updated, and will lead to creation of new (duplicate) record in the database, not overwriting. As the system replaces the entire record, you must provide the full submission object once again, including all fields and not just the altered ones. Failing to provide information in required fields will lead to rejection of the change, and the old record will remain. Failing to provide information in optional fields will empty those fields, even if they were filled before, and will thus cause deletion of the information. Sandbox \u00b6 The DEQAR Sandbox, like any sandbox, is intended for you to \u201cplay\u201d, enabling you to trial particular submission methods, data structures, formats and syntax. More specifically, it is a space where we encourage (even urge) you to test your submissions before putting them into the live system. The Sandbox is reached through separate links: To test the manual and CSV submission, go to the Sandbox Administrative Interface at: https://admin.sandbox.deqar.eu/ To test API submission, go to the Sandbox Submission API at: https://backend.sandbox.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report To see what your records will eventually look like on the public site, go to the Sandbox Public Interface at: https://sandbox.deqar.eu/ The Sandbox is an identical copy of the live system. The entire data of the live site is copied over to the Sandbox every night. Thus, your login and password are the same as in your DEQAR account\u2014unless you have made changes within the last 24 hours. You can also reset or change your password in the Sandbox, but it will be overwritten by the next day.","title":"Report Submission"},{"location":"data_submission/#report-submission","text":"Each agency should follow four discrete steps to prepare their data submission: Choose a particular submission method .

Sanity checks may result in low-level flags for the following reasons: Report is on an institution in a country in which the agency has not previously been active. Validity From date of a report is more than one year before the submission date. (NB: this check is suspended during the uploading of legacy data from each agency.) Country of the Institution does not match the country of one or more of its programmes. Report on an Institution in the EHEA is submitted without the QF-EHEA levels provided.

The email address linked to your login is the same email address to which submission report emails are sent. If you do not remember which email address is linked to your agency's login, please contact the EQAR Secretariat. The webform can be found in the menu under Submit Report > Report Form . Required fields are marked with a * in the form; fields marked with a (*) are conditionally required. Please note that the Activity chosen might influence which information is required (see Report Data Elements above). The Save Record button becomes active once all required information has been provided. We strongly recommend that you provide a Local Report Identifier that identifies the specific report in your own information system or workflow, even when you use the webform. This will facilitate later updates should they be necessary, and can be useful if your agency changes to CSV upload or the Submission API later on. You can select institutions using the search box. If you are uploading a report on an institution that has no DEQAR record yet, see Institution Data on how to add it before uploading reports. Data on programmes will only be needed if your report results from a programme-level activity. Fill the form with the required information and then click the Add Programme button. If the report concerns several programmes (e.g. clustered evaluation) please repeat the step for all programmes concerned. (See Programme Data Elements above.) Each report may contain one or more report files (for example, the experts' report, a possible summary report and the decision taken might be contained all in one or in separate files). The report file fields are conditionally required. At least one must be present, but agencies can either provide a URL or upload a file directly (in either case, only PDF files are accepted).

A simple example of a CSV first-fow header for institution-level reports could look as follows: agency, activity, status, decision, valid_from, valid_to, date_format, file[1].original_location, file[1].report_language[1], institution[1].eter_id (Spaces added for readability, these should not appear in an actual file.) One report may often include/relate to several items, such as one or more institution(s), programmes or one or more files--some in several languages. In those cases you will find field names of the type field_name[n] (See Report Data Elements above). You should create as many columns as you need and replace n by 1, 2, ... For example, two files (e.g. full report in local language, and summary in both English and local language) can be provided as follows: ..., file[1].original_location, file[1].display_name, file[1].report_language[1], file[2].original_location, file[2].display_name, file[2].report_language[1], file[2].report_language[1], ... ..., \"http://some.url/to/report\", \"Expert report\", \"de\", \"http://some.url/to/report\", \"Summary\", \"en\", \"de\", ...

If a record already exists in DEQAR, the institutions needs to be identified; otherwise, the institution must be created before a report can be submitted. DEQAR has records on a large number of higher education institutions (over 4000 institutions from 42 European countries) harvested from the ETER/OrgReg databases (available through Research infrastructure for research and innovation policy studies - RISIS or European Tertiary Education Register - ETER . More than 2000 additional institutions are already recorded in DEQAR based on other official sources (e.g. lists by national ministries) or have already been added by other agencies. Finding Existing Institutions \u00b6 Existing institutions need to be identified by their DEQARINST ID, ETER ID or a local or national identifier (if available). Admin Interface \u00b6 All institution identifiers can be found through the administrative interface . Important: The public DEQAR website does not show all institutions, but only those institutions for which at least one report is available. It is therefore important that you always search for institutions in the administrative interface , as DEQAR contains records on several hundreds of institutions for which no reports have been submitted yet. Reports on existing institutions can be submitted directly, providing identifiers in CSV or JSON objects as described under Submission Object Data Elements: Institution(s) or by selecting the institution in the web form. Download CSV File \u00b6 The full list of higher education institutions can also be downloaded as a CSV file from: https://www.eqar.eu/qa-results/download-data-sets/ Connect API \u00b6 The full institution list can be accessed and searched using the Connect API. EQAR-registered agencies have access to the Connect API using the same credentials as for the DEQAR administrative interface, the Submission API and the Web API. Please refer to the explanations on authentication for the Submission API for information on how to obtain and use a token. The base URL for the Connect API is: https://backend.deqar.eu/connectapi/v1 The endpoint https://backend.deqar.eu/connectapi/v1/institutions/ allows to query the full list of higher education institutions, with or without reports. The full definitions of the endpoint, the search parameters and the response object is available as OpenAPI Specification 3.0 at: https://backend.deqar.eu/connectapi/v1/swagger/ To retrieve the details on a single institution, please use the Web API endpoint . Defining Institutions \u00b6 Before suggesting to add a new institution, please consider the following notes: DEQAR mainly follows European Tertiary Education Register's (ETER) data model and coverage . The primary unit of registration is the university/higher education institution, i.e. an institution of higher learning that awards academic degrees in diverse disciplines, is organised as central unit and consists of separate functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments). Functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments) themselves are not registered in DEQAR as separate entity. Reports on functional units are uploaded/recorded/shown under the central unit's record. Reports on consortia consisting of several universities will be showcased in the record of each university separately. Consortia themselves will not be presented as a central unit. Only in exceptional cases, when the consortium has a long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as an institution itself, will it be registered as a separate institution in DEQAR. Reports on institutions' branches and campuses, home and abroad, will be showcased in the record of the central institution (i.e. the university). Only in exceptional cases, where the branch/campus has a proven long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as a semi-independent institution, will it be registered in DEQAR. In cases when the status of the entity is not clearly determined by the aforementioned cases or the status is debatable, EQAR and the agency will discuss the nature of it taking into account five main indicators: legal status organisational independence financial independence stakeholders\u2019 perceptions local context and approaches to higher education Institution Data Elements \u00b6 If a record for an institution does not already exist in DEQAR it should be described with the elements below; required elements are marked by (*) .

The primary unit of registration is the university/higher education institution, i.e. an institution of higher learning that awards academic degrees in diverse disciplines, is organised as central unit and consists of separate functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments). Functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments) themselves are not registered in DEQAR as separate entity. Reports on functional units are uploaded/recorded/shown under the central unit's record. Reports on consortia consisting of several universities will be showcased in the record of each university separately. Consortia themselves will not be presented as a central unit. Only in exceptional cases, when the consortium has a long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as an institution itself, will it be registered as a separate institution in DEQAR. Reports on institutions' branches and campuses, home and abroad, will be showcased in the record of the central institution (i.e. the university). Only in exceptional cases, where the branch/campus has a proven long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as a semi-independent institution, will it be registered in DEQAR.

We accomplish this through: an easily searchable database of institutions where users can find up-to-date QA reports for download; the provision of a basic set of standardised data on a range of agency activities; linked contextual data on national QA requirements and QA agencies, allowing users to understand the status and nature of QA reports. Download Quick Start Guide Getting Started \u00b6 To get started with DEQAR, it is a good idea to first take measure of your agency\u2019s needs to determine: What to Upload? \u00b6 Take stock of the activities you undertake and the past and current reports which are eligible for DEQAR. Only upload those reports on activities that were confirmed to be within the scope of the ESG when the reports were created. Note: the list of eligible activities can be found on the register record for the agency ( https://www.eqar.eu/register/agencies/ ) and also in the DEQAR administrative interface accessible after the agency activates its account (see below: Activate your Account ). If a new activity is introduced, then a formal change report should be submitted to the EQAR secretariat before the activity is deemed eligible in DEQAR. For other changes to activities, please contact the EQAR secretariat: info@eqar.eu Only upload reports created since the date of the agency\u2019s registration on EQAR (i.e. the date of the first external review of your agency against the ESG). Upload legacy data , i.e. the backlog of reports published since registration with EQAR. Note: if your agency is newly registered, then you should have little if any legacy data. Upload current data , i.e. reports you have recently completed (or will complete in the future). It is necessary to meet certain data requirements in order for reports to be ingested into the system. Data requirements for reports vary depending on the type of activity described. Ensure that you have this data available or can generate it as needed. Note: there are a few \u201csoft requirements\u201d for DEQAR which are not necessary for ingest but which do trigger a red or yellow alert flag in the system. For details, please see: Report Data Elements Data Pipeline How to Upload? \u00b6 Take stock of the size of your organisation, available staff and technical expertise as well as the volume of activities you undertake. Each agency can choose one (or more) methods for submitting data. The DEQAR team has provided three submission methods tailored to different agencies\u2019 needs: a manual upload for individual reports; CSV file upload for larger batches of reports; and an API which automatically uploads reports from your local database as they are created, individually or in batches. Note: these three methods are interoperable and can be used in different situations by the same agency. You should determine which option or options best suits your agency. For details, please see: Choosing a Submission Method Finding your Legs in DEQAR \u00b6 Once you have figured out what you will submit and how, then it is time to enter the system. Activate your Account \u00b6 Access the DEQAR account for your agency and confirm existing information. To activate your agency\u2019s account, contact the EQAR secretariat at: deqar@eqar.eu Note: unless you wish otherwise, the account information (contact name and email) will be based on the information on the agency already in our system. Enter DEQAR\u2019s Administrative User Interface using the following link: https://admin.deqar.eu Visit your agency\u2019s Profile under My Data: to freely update the DEQAR contact information and password as suits your needs.

The institution list can be found on the EQAR Admin Interface at: https://admin.deqar.eu/institutions Note: the base institution list has been taken from the European Tertiary Education Register (ETER/OrgReg; https://risis-eter.orgreg.joanneum.at/about/intro ). If institutions are missing from the list, please contact the EQAR secretariat: deqar@eqar.eu to arrange for the data to be imported. For details, see Institution Data . Get to Know the System \u00b6 Familiarise yourself with the administrative interface and the Sandbox. Once in the system, you should become familiar with the different modules available to you through the administrative interface: My Data: including records on your uploaded reports as well as your agency's profile (see above); (coming soon) alerts and flags management. Submit Reports: giving access to the manual and CSV submission methods (see below for API). Reference Data: including records on all uploaded reports and records on all higher education institutions currently in DEQAR; (coming soon) all agencies and countries in DEQAR. If you are planning to use the submission API, you can use API token found in your agency Profile and the following link: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report The Sandbox is reached through a separate link. The DEQAR Sandbox, like any sandbox, is intended for you to \u201cplay\u201d, enabling you to trial particular submission methods, data structures, formats and syntax. More specifically, it is a space where we encourage (even urge) you to test your submissions before putting them into the live system: To test the manual and CSV submission, go to the Sandbox Administrative Interface at: https://admin.sandbox.deqar.eu/ To test API submission, go to the Sandbox Submission API at: https://backend.sandbox.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report To see what your records will eventually look like on the public site, go to the Sandbox Public Interface at: https://sandbox.deqar.eu/ Note: the entire data of the live site is copied over to the Sandbox every night. Thus, your login and password are the same as in your DEQAR account\u2014unless you have made changes within the last 24 hours. You can also reset or change your password in the Sandbox, but it will be overwritten by the next day. Perform your First Submission \u00b6 To perform your first submission\u2014whether through the manual upload, CSV or API\u2014we strongly encourage every agency to use the Sandbox. When you are ready to submit to the live site, please contact the EQAR secretariat at: deqar@eqar.eu . This will allow us to check your proposed data (particularly if submitted as a CSV), walk you through the submission process one last time and double check your results. DEQAR in the Longer Term \u00b6 Make a Road Map \u00b6 Determine internal priorities and work methods. Legacy data: if applicable, determine a timeframe and method for uploading legacy reports, i.e. reports created since registration with EQAR. As a rule, it is a good idea to use a batch upload method (CSV or API) for legacy data. Current data: set a continuous workflow to ensure that DEQAR is kept up to date with current activities. Determine: at what point in the work process will reports be uploaded to DEQAR? will reports be uploaded one-by-one upon completion or in batches, e.g. every month or every quarter? Note: methods for submitting legacy data \u2014 which is generally done in a few large batches \u2014 may be quite distinct from methods for continuous submission. Stay Connected \u00b6 Stick with your road map and adapt your methods as needed. Remember: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Once you commit to using DEQAR, it is important to stick with it so that your agency\u2019s presence in the system is as continuous and coherent as possible. Be sure to load new reports soon after they are ready for publication; otherwise you risk confusing the public, institutions or other agencies. You are encouraged to adapt the method and timing of submissions to best fit your internal work processes. On our side, we have tried to design DEQAR to be as effortless as possible. We hope that the system will prove a boost rather than a burden to your QA work. Note: the DEQAR front end user interface is built using an API. This means that any agency may embed a version of DEQAR (included full search functionality) in its own website to alleviate some of the burden on the local IT team.

Download Quick Start Guide","title":"Stay Connected"},{"location":"report_data/","text":"Report Data Elements \u00b6 Agencies are asked to prepare data on quality assurance reports for submission to DEQAR. A submission object is data related to a single report and is used during ingest to populate report records and to establish linkages inside the system. Submission objects can be packaged together for batch submission. Though they are used mostly to introduce new report records into DEQAR, submission objects can also be used to update information on existing records through batch submission. Deletion of existing records can be requested, but final deletion can only be performed by DEQAR administrators. Below we provide a full list of the data elements that can make up a submission object. It is important to note that the below list is exhaustive, including all possible elements. Required data elements are listed in bold with a * , conditionally required data elements in bold with a (*). We use the terminology: \"must\" to denote that an element is required or required in certain situations \"should\" to denote that an element is highly recommended \"may\" to denote that an element is optional (See RFC 2119 Best Current Practice .) The structure of the elements below best reflects our CSV template. To see how these elements are arrayed in JSON for API submission, see our JSON definition at: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/swagger/ Please note that new records for institutions not currently represented in DEQAR should be submitted separately beforehand. Please use the dedicated CSV template described above .

Programme group reports are created for programmes with a similar profile across the entire sector on a 7-year rotating basis. Agency \u00b6 A single creating agency must be clearly identified for each report. The creating agency is often, though not always, the same as the submitting agency (see Agency Identifiers ). When a report is co-created by several EQAR-registered agencies, one of the agencies needs to take responsibility for uploading the report to DEQAR and keeping it up-to-date. This one should be specified as (main) Agency, the other ones as Contributing Agencies. Agency* ( agency ; required; string) The (main) agency which created the report must be provided for each report as an agency acronym or as a DEQAR agency ID. This allows the report to be linked to an existing agency record and makes it possible to validate and transform the submitted data in accordance with the agency's profile. e.g. AAQ e.g. 33 Contributing Agencies ( contributing_agencies[n] ; not required; string) Additional EQAR-registered agencies that were involved in the external QA procedure and the production of the report. Contributing agencies can only be recorded if they were registered in EQAR at the time of issuing of the report ( valid_from date). Otherwise, all validation and flagging rules follow the main agency. The report will also be shown under the contributing agencies\u2019 profiles in DEQAR. e.g. MusiQuE e.g. 34 Report Identifier \u00b6 A report identifier must be used when submitting updates to an existing report in CSV or JSON. Each report can be identified using an agency's local identifiers or through DEQAR report IDs, which are assigned at upload. It is recommended that agencies submit local report identifiers with every submission object (see Report and Programme Identifiers ). DEQAR Report ID ( report_id ; not required; string) Each uploaded report is assigned a unique DEQAR report ID. This may be used to submit updates to existing reports or to promote synchronisation with an agency's local system. e.g. 000786 Local Report Identifier ( local_identifier ; not required; string) The report identifier used in the agency's local system should be provided for each report. This may be used to submit updates to existing reports or to promote synchronisation with the agency's local system; the local report identifier is particularly useful in the identification of invalid submission objects. e.g. QAA1153-March15 Activity \u00b6 A single activity must be assigned to each report. Activities are selected from the agency's pre-defined list of activities and should be provided as a DEQAR value (as either a string value or a DEQAR activity ID). Optionally an agency may choose to provide local identifiers for its own activities; before these can be used for submission, these identifiers should be assigned through the agency record in the administrative interface (see Role of Standards and Identifiers: Other Identifiers . If both elements are submitted for a single report, then the DEQAR value will be used by the system. Activity(*) ( activity ; conditionally required; string) A DEQAR activity value may be provided as an activity name or DEQAR activity ID for each report. The activity is used to validate the structure of submitted report data. e.g. institutional audit e.g. programme evaluation e.g. 2 e.g. 8 Activity Local Identifier(*) ( activity_local_identifier ; conditionally required; string) A local activity identifier may optionally be provided in place of a DEQAR activity value for each report. The local activity identifier may be used to validate the structure of submitted report data. (Note: local activity identifiers need to be assigned through the administrative interface before they can be used in submission.) e.g. inst_aud Each activity is classified as one of four activity types ( activity_type ). These classifications determine the structure of the report record. Type Report record structure institutional at least one institution no programme institutional/programme one and only one institution at least one programme programme one and only one institution at least one programme joint programme at least two institutions at least one programme Details \u00b6 Each report must be assigned a single status and a single decision value. Together these elements signal the role, status and nature of the report. Status and decision values may be provided as either string values or DEQAR IDs. Status* ( status ; required; string) The status must be provided as either a DEQAR status name or a DEQAR status id for each report. The status specifies whether the report is part of the obligatory EQA system in the country of the institution or whether the institution has undertaken it voluntarily. NB The status \"part of obligatory EQA system\" may only be used in the EHEA. ID name 1 part of obligatory EQA system 2 voluntary Decision* ( decision ; required; string) The decision must be provided as either a DEQAR decision name or a DEQAR decision id for each report. The decision records the final result of the QA procedure/report. ID name 1 positive 2 positive with conditions or restrictions 3 negative 4 not applicable Summary ( summary ; not required; string) A textual summary of the key findings of the report/decision that allows users to understand the outcomes without reading the full report. Strongly recommended, the summary should be in English. Comment ( other_comment ; not required; string) The optional comment can contain important information on the report that cannot be represented in the structured data, e.g. involvement of other partner agencies or any specific notes about the QA procedure. e.g. Evaluation undertaken in cooperation with MusiQuE. e.g. Programme group reports are created for programmes with a similar profile across the entire sector on a 7-year rotating basis. Validity \u00b6 Each report must have an associated date defining the start of its validity. A date defining the end of the report's validity should also be provided. In the cases that the end date is left open, the report will be treated as valid for six years from the start of its validity, after which it will be archived. DEQAR uses a special notation to denote the date format. This allows each agency to signal the date format it uses; this must be provided for each report. Valid from* ( valid_from ; required; date) A valid from date marking the starting date of the report's validity must be provided for each report. This date is used to generate an archiving date when no valid to date is provided. e.g. 2015-01-15 Valid to ( valid_to ; not required; date) A valid to date marking the ending date of the report's validity should be provided for each report. This date determines when report data will be archived in DEQAR. If no valid to date is assigned, then the report will be treated as valid for six years after the valid from date. e.g. 2020-01-15 Date Format* ( date_format ; required; string) A date format must be provided for each report. Dates may be submitted in any standard format; the format should be represented as a combination of the following characters: symbol(s) meaning example %d day as expressed in two digits 02 %-d day as expressed in one or two digits 2 %m month as expressed in two digits 05 for May %-m month as expressed in one or two digits 5 for May and 12 for December %Y year as expressed in four digits 2014 %y year as expressed in two digits 14 %d-%m-%Y 04-01-2014 %d/%m/%y 04/01/14 %Y-%m-%d 2015-01-15 Files \u00b6 DEQAR requires PDF versions of quality assurance reports for every submission object. Agencies can choose either to make files available for harvest or to upload files. In order to make files available for harvest, agencies must provide the URL for files already available on a public server. Alternatively, files may be submitted using the API or uploaded through the administrative interface. All reports must be submitted with data on the language(s) used in the report. A file display name can be provided as well. ELEMENT NAME REQUIRED ONE/MANY EXAMPLE File Original Location(*) conditionally many http://estudis.aqu.cat/MAD2014_UPC_es.pdf File Display Name no one (per) Report Evaluation MAD2014_UPC_es.pdf Report Language* yes many (per) es spa File Original Location(*) ( file[n].original_location ; conditionally required; string) At least one PDF file should be provided with each submitted report in the form of a URL. Optionally, PDF files can be uploaded through the API or user interface. e.g. http://estudis.aqu.cat/MAD2014_UPC_es.pdf The URL SHOULD return the HTTP content-type header application/pdf upon a HEAD request. The URL MUST return application/pdf upon a GET request. If another content-type is reported, the file will not be downloaded and saved. The maximum filesize is 10MB. File Display Name ( file[n].display_name ; not required; string) A single file display name may be provided for each PDF report file, used for the file link in DEQAR. If no display name is provided, then the file name will be used for display instead. e.g. Report e.g. Evaluation e.g. MAD2014_UPC_es.pdf This should be a short and generic term (such as \u201cReport and Decision\u201d, \u201cEvaluation Report\u201d, \u201cAccreditation Decision\u201d, \u201cSummary report\u201d, ...). The display name should not repeat the name of the institution or programme addressed in the report. Report Language* ( file[n].report_language[n] ; required; string) One or more languages must be provided for each file in the form of an ISO 639 1 (two-digit) or ISO 639 2 (three digit) language code (see ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2/B format ). e.g. es e.g. spa Link \u00b6 One or more links may be provided to alternative views of the report data on the agency's own website or other webpage(s) in order to provide more context. If one link is provided, it will be displayed with the text \"View record on agency's website\". If several links are provided, display names must be provided for each link. These texts will be displayed on DEQAR in order to distinguish the different links. Link ( link[n] , not required, string) One or more URL links may be provided for each report to the same report presented on other sites in order to provide more context to the report. e.g. http://srv.aneca.es/ListadoTitulos/node/1182321350 Link Display Name ( link_display_name[n] , conditionally required, string) A short text describing where the link points to; required and used only when several links are provided. e.g. report in national qualifications database e.g. decision on ministry's website Institution(s) \u00b6 Each report must be associated with at least one institution. The record(s) for the institution(s) need(s) to already exists in DEQAR, see the previous section on adding missing insitutions to DEQAR . Preferably, the DEQARINST ID or the ETER ID should be provided to identify the institution(s). Optionally, an agency may choose to use local or national identifiers for institutions. Before these can be used for submission, local identifiers should be assigned to existing institution records through the administrative interface or provided in bulk to the EQAR secretariat. Only one institution identifier should be submitted for each institution in the submission object (see Institution Identifiers ). If more than one identifying element is submitted, then the DEQARINST ID will be used to establish internal linkage, followed by the ETER ID, followed by the local identifier. ELEMENT NAME REQUIRED ONE/MANY EXAMPLE DEQARINST ID(*) conditionally one (per) DEQARINST0034 ETER ID(*) conditionally one (per) BG0001 Institutional Identifier(*) conditionally one (per) HCERES21 AT0004 Identifier Resource conditionally one (per) SI-ETER.BAS.NATID Erasmus DEQARINST ID(*) ( institution[n].deqar_id ; conditionally required; string) Each institution already described in DEQAR is assigned a DEQARINST ID. The DEQARINST ID may be used to establish a link between submitted report data and an existing institution record. e.g. DEQARINST0034 ETER ID(*) ( institution[n].eter_id ; conditionally required; string) Each institution described in OrgReg or ETER is assigned an ETER ID (see Research infrastructure for research and innovation policy studies - RISIS or European Tertiary Education Register - ETER ). The ETER ID may be used to establish a link between submitted report data and an ETER record in DEQAR. e.g. BG0001 Institutional Identifier(*) ( institution[n].identifier[1] ; conditionally required; string) A local identifier is any identifier used by the Agency to identify an institution, while other identifiers can be recorded in DEQAR for use by all agencies. These may optionally be used in the place of a DEQARINST ID or ETER ID to establish a link between submitted report data and an existing institution record. (Note: local institution identifiers need to be assigned through the administrative interface or in bulk through the EQAR secretariat before they can be used in submission; other identifiers can be consulted in the administrative interface and can be assigned in consultation with the EQAR secretariat.) e.g. HCERES21 e.g. AT0004 Identifier Resource ( institution[n].resource[1] ; conditionally required; string) If the identifier you use is not a local identifier of your agency, you need to provide its corresponding resource tag. The value for this field can be consulted through the administrative interface. e.g. DE-HRK e.g. SI-ETER.BAS.NATID e.g. Erasmus Programme Data \u00b6 Information on one or more programmes is required for all reports with the assigned activity types: institutional/programme ; programme ; or joint programme . As a rule, programme information must be entered anew for each report, though DEQAR allows agencies to assign local programme identifiers in order to track reports on the same programme or to reuse programme information in later reports. A local identifier may be submitted along with the report data in CSV or JSON; additional local identifiers can also be assigned through the administrative interface. (Note, if no existing identifier is used, then as a minimum the programme name must be provided for programme data to be valid.) ELEMENT NAME REQUIRED ONE/MANY EXAMPLE Local Programme Identifier no many (per) 61 60800 Primary Programme Name(*) conditionally one (per) Arts-specialist in opleiding Programme Qualification no one (per) Master in de specialistische geneeskunde Programme Name Alternative no many (per) Medical Natural Sciences Programme Qualification Alternative no many (per) Master of Medicine Programme Country no many (per) BE BEL Programme NQF Level no one (per) level 6 level 7 Programme QF-EHEA Level no one (per) 0 - short cycle 1 - first cycle 2 - second cycle 3 - third cycle Programme Identification \u00b6 An identifier may be submitted with programme information to allow the agency to identify reports on the same programme or to reuse the same programme information in a later record (see Report and Programme Identifiers ). (Note: if an existing identifier is submitted with new programme information, the previous data will be used in place of the new.) Local Programme Identifier ( programme[n].identifier[1] ; not required; string) One local programme identifier may be provided for each programme associated with the submitted report. Once the identifier has been submitted, the agency can identify reports on the same programme in the system and may reference it in later reports to reuse the same programme data. e.g. 61 e.g. 60800 Programme Name and Qualification \u00b6 One and only one primary programme name must be provided for each programme associated with the report. The programme name should be accompanied by a qualification title in the same language. Agencies may also provide alternative or other language versions of the programme name and/or qualification. The primary name will be used for display. Primary Programme Name(*) ( programme[n].name_primary ; conditionally required; string) One and only one primary name must be provided for each programme associated with the submitted report. It is recommended to provide the primary program name in English. e.g. Medical Natural Sciences Programme Qualification ( programme[n].qualification_primary ; not required; string) The qualification offered by each programme should be recorded in the same language that is used for primary name. e.g. Master of Medicine Programme Name Alternative ( programme[n].name_alternative[n] ; not required; string) One or more alternative or other language names may be provided for each programme associated with the submitted report, e.g. in the local language. e.g. Arts-specialist in opleiding Programme Qualification Alternative ( programme[n].qualification_alternative[n] ; not required; string) The qualification offered by each programme may be recorded in the same language that is used for the alternative name version. e.g. Master in de specialistische geneeskunde Programme Location \u00b6 Information on the country/ies where each programme is located should be provided if different from the host institution country.

A submission object is data related to a single report and is used during ingest to populate report records and to establish linkages inside the system. Submission objects can be packaged together for batch submission. Though they are used mostly to introduce new report records into DEQAR, submission objects can also be used to update information on existing records through batch submission. Deletion of existing records can be requested, but final deletion can only be performed by DEQAR administrators. Below we provide a full list of the data elements that can make up a submission object. It is important to note that the below list is exhaustive, including all possible elements. Required data elements are listed in bold with a * , conditionally required data elements in bold with a (*). We use the terminology: \"must\" to denote that an element is required or required in certain situations \"should\" to denote that an element is highly recommended \"may\" to denote that an element is optional (See RFC 2119 Best Current Practice .) The structure of the elements below best reflects our CSV template. To see how these elements are arrayed in JSON for API submission, see our JSON definition at: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/swagger/ Please note that new records for institutions not currently represented in DEQAR should be submitted separately beforehand.
