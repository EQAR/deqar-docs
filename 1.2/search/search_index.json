DEQAR enhances access to quality assurance reports and decisions on higher education providers and/or their educational programmes. The quality of the organisations/programmes is externally reviewed against the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area (ESG), by an EQAR-registered agency. The database is expected to satisfy the information needs of a broad range of users, including but not limited to: Recognition information centres (ENIC-NARICs) Recognition officers in higher education institutions Students Quality assurance agencies Ministry representatives and other national authorities Employers The database also supports different types of activities (e.g. issuing digital credentials, recognition of degrees, mobility of students, portability of grants/loans, etc.). Through this database, EQAR thus contributes to the transparency of external quality assurance in the European Higher Education Area. EU funding \u00b6 The development and initial maintenance of DEQAR was financially supported by the Erasmus+ programme of the European Union. The initial DEQAR project was selected for EU co-funding under Erasmus+ Key Action 3 - European Forward-Looking Cooperation Projects. It ran from November 2017 to October 2019. More about the project and partners involved The DEQAR CONNECT project was selected for EU co-funding in 2020 and ran until June 2022. More about DEQAR CONNECT and the partners involved .

In case you are interested to contribute to the codebase or you would like to share your thoughts and ideas, you are welcome to do so through the DEQAR GitHub page Terminology \u00b6 In the present documentation, we use different keywords: Requirement levels \u00b6 The documentation uses the definitions in RFC 2119 , which is widely-used in internet standards. That is: \" Must \" signals that the element (or cluster of elements) has to be provided; otherwise the record in question will be rejected. \" Should \" signals that we highly recommend that the element (or cluster of elements) be provided, unless providing it would be impossible in the particular case or cause prohibitively large effort. \" May \" signals that the element (or cluster of elements) is truly optional, and can be provided if applicable or if the agency feels it might be useful. Data types \u00b6 The data types used in DEQAR follow the common definitions: String : sequence of characters, digits, or symbols \u2013 always treated as text (e.g. 0034 ; institutional accreditation ; 1 ) Date : sequence of numbers pointing to a day and month within a calendar year (e.g. 2023-08-02 ); where it is indicated so, the date format can be specified (e.g. see report validity ), otherwise dates must be provided in the format YYYY-MM-DD (i.e. in date format %Y-%m-%d ). Integer : Numeric data type for numbers without fractions (e.g. 2 ) Definitions \u00b6 Provider : any actor that provides degree programmes, micro-credentials or other learning opportunities in terms of teaching, classes, learning materials, etc. This may include higher education institutions (public, private, academic, professional, preparatory, initial, continuing, adult, local, foreign, cross-border, European or international), as well as other providers, including employers, companies, social partners, NGOs, public authorities and others. Higher education institution ( HEI ): an entity that has full degree awarding powers at higher education level (i.e. EQF levels 5 to 8; QF-EHEA cycle first to third) recognised by at least one national authority. Other provider : an entity that provides learning opportunities at higher education level (i.e. EQF levels 5 to 8; QF-EHEA cycle short to third), but that does not have full (recognised) degree awarding powers themselves. Awarder : the body that certifies the provision. The awarding body may differ from the provider, e.g. in the case of partnerships, franchise. Programme : learning provision that can lead to a full degree (traditional programmes offered by HEIs) or to another type of certificate (i.e. micro-credentials or other provisions offered by HEIs or other providers). Whenever there is a difference, the handbook points to \u201cprogramme leading to full degree\u201d and \u201cprogramme not leading to a full degree\u201d (e.g. micro-credentials). Micro-credential : a certified small volume of learning (i.e. workload <60 ECTS), not leading to a full (recognised) degree. Micro-credentials may be provided through a cooperation of different providers. Other provision : a larger volume of learning (i.e. workload \u226560 ECTS), not leading to a full (recognised) degree. Joint programme : an integrated curriculum coordinated and offered jointly by different higher education institutions, and leading to double/multiple degrees or a joint degree. Full (recognised) degree : a document awarded by a higher education institution that attests the successful completion of a programme at QF level (5), 6, 7 or 8 and that is officially recognised as part of the national system by at least one national authority in the EHEA. Joint degree : a single document awarded by higher education institutions offering the joint programme attesting the successful completion of this programme and nationally acknowledged as the recognised award of the joint programme. Double/multiple degrees : separate degrees awarded by higher education institutions offering the joint programme attesting the successful completion of this programme (if two degrees are awarded by two institutions, this is a \u2018double degree\u2019). QF-EHEA level : a cycle defined in the overarching Framework of Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area (QF-EHEA); when used for a programme, the indication of a level refers to the learning outcomes of the programme aligning with the generic learning outcomes as defined for the given cycle in the QF-EHEA. Entity relationship diagrams \u00b6 The explanations of the data model are accompanied by entity relationship diagrams with the commonly-used Crow's foot notation .

Information on higher education providers is managed by the EQAR Secretariat. The information on higher education institutions is largely based on data from ETER/OrgReg. The information on other providers is provided by QA agencies and managed by the EQAR Secretariat. EQAR continues to collect and manage agency data, through its register, as well as country data in its knowledge base. These will be linked to report and provider data in DEQAR. To support this, DEQAR also includes a country entity, which contains information on the official external quality assurance regime in the countries/higher education systems of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). erDiagram PROVIDER }o--|{ COUNTRY : \"based in\" AGENCY }o--|{ COUNTRY : \"operates in\" PROGRAMME }o--o| COUNTRY : \"located in\" Functional Overview \u00b6 DEQAR supports three core activities: Submission of report records: agencies submit report records and PDF files, meeting defined criteria, using one of three methods: as individual records via webform as batch CSV file via webform as JSON using an API Administration of records: data is ingested and records are created, stored and managed by EQAR staff and agencies over the longer term. Agencies may update report records already in the system and track their own activity. Search and discovery of information: records are published on a public web interface for search, retrieval and export or download by end users. There is also a public API available to all registered users; this allows users to embed DEQAR search interface in their local site. Role of Standards and Identifiers \u00b6 As DEQAR aggregates data from different sources, several challenges are faced: to keep the same data from different sources synchronised (e.g. the same provider may be described differently by different agencies); to try to avoid duplication; to identify already existing records for update if necessary. Hence, to ensure consistency and stability, DEQAR uses a set of standard identifiers, which are provided by the system for each object. In several cases, agencies are able to provide their local or national identifiers for objects in order to ease their internal workflows. Objects are identified in the following ways: Object Recommended Identification Alternative Identification Agency DEQAR Agency ID agency acronym Activity DEQAR Activity ID activity local identifier, activity name Reports local report identifier DEQAR Report ID Provider DEQARINST ID ETER ID, local identifier, other identifier Programme local programme identifier erDiagram REPORT { int DEQAR_report_id string local_identifier } AGENCY { int DEQAR_agency_id string agency_acronym } ACTIVITY { int DEQAR_activity_id string local_identifier string activity_name } PROVIDER { string DEQARINST_id string ETER_ID string local_identifier string other_identfiier } PROGRAMME { int DEQAR_programme_id string local_identifier } REPORT }o--|| AGENCY : \"belongs to\" REPORT }o--|| ACTIVITY : \"is part of\" REPORT }o--|{ PROVIDER : \"focuses on\" REPORT ||--o{ PROGRAMME : \"may focus on\" As a rule, objects already in the system should be identified to facilitate linking up. In other words: The agency responsible for the report and the activity to which it belongs must be identified with any submission . An identifier must be provided for each provider (higher education institution or other provider) covered by the report. If provider records do not yet exist in DEQAR, information on them must be provided separately before reports can be submitted. In the case of reports and programmes , agencies are encouraged to provide local identifiers with each new submission of data in order to facilitate subsequent linking: For reports, the agency can provide a local identifier with each new report submitted; the local identifier may be used to later update the report using CSV or JSON and may also help each agency to synchronise its local system with DEQAR. For programmes, the first time an agency provides information on a programme to DEQAR, a local (or national) identifier can be submitted along with data on the programme; the identifier can later be used by the agency for any report on the same programme. The identification of each type of object is explained in detail below. Agency Identifiers \u00b6 Authentication is required before the submission and update of data and files. Thus, the agency responsible for each report can be identified automatically by the system. In some cases, an agency may serve as a proxy agency for a creating agency , submitting and managing data on its behalf (as in the case of umbrella organisations). In this case, the creating agency\u2019s unique acronym or DEQAR Agency ID (which can be found in the administrative interface) must be provided as the source of identification. For this reason, identification of the creating agency is required for each object when using CSV and JSON. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Agency .) Activity Identifiers \u00b6 DEQAR also assigns IDs to each agency's activities (see list on the agency's public register entry under Activities within the scope of ESG ). These identifiers, which can be found through the administrative interface, should be used to indicate the type of report in each CSV or JSON object. Alternatively, an agency may wish to use its own local activity identifiers; in this case, the agency should supply through their local identifiers through the administrative interface before using them for submission. Note: Only one identifier should be provided for the assigned activity. Please note that any changes to the agency's activities, other than purely editorial or technical changes, must be made through Substantive Change Reports . (See Submission Object Data Elements: Activity .) Report Identifiers \u00b6 We strongly recommend that agencies provide a local identifier with each report submitted. This will allow for subsequent updates to the record and will ease synchronisation with the agency's local system. Report local identifiers will be stored and can serve to identify records for updates/resubmissions. DEQAR will also automatically generate a DEQAR ID for each newly submitted report; this will be returned to agencies as part of the response object. The DEQAR ID can be used for updates/resubmission as an alternative to local identifiers. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Report Identifier .) Provider Identifiers \u00b6 Providersi must be identified in report submissions using one of the following identifiers. This allows the system to automatically link report data to existing institution records. DEQARINST IDs : DEQAR automatically generates a so-called \"DEQARINST ID\" for each provider record that is created in the system. These can be found through the administrative interface. (They are also returned to the agency as part of the response object after each successful submission.) Ideally, each registered agency will store the DEQARINST IDs for providers treated in their reports. These are recommended for use in each submission. ETER IDs : DEQAR creates and updates records on higher education institutions from many European countries from the ETER/OrgReg database every 24 hours. The ETER ID for these institutions can be found through the administrative interface. The ETER IDs may be stored and used by agencies for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs. Local identifiers : Agencies may also create and store local identifiers for providers. These can be used for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs if supplied in advance. Each agency can provide these individually through the administrative interface or these can be provided in bulk to the EQAR Secretariat. Local identifiers are managed by one agency independently and can only be used by that agency. Other identifiers : DEQAR allows to store additional national, European or other identifiers. These can be used for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs and are available to all agencies; other identifiers available in the system can be consulted through the administrative interface. In order to ensure uniqueness and stability these are managed by the EQAR secretariat, but agencies are invited to provide identifiers to EQAR that might be useful to other agencies. Other identifiers are always used in combination with a resource indication, denoting the type of identifier, in combination with which they are unique. EQAR maintains a background list of other trusted identifiers . Agencies and other stakeholders can contact EQAR if they want to provide other identifiers. Note: If an agency cannot locate an existing provider record in DEQAR (and therefore cannot provide either the DEQARINST ID, ETER ID or local identifier), then it will need to provide data separately before being able to submit reports on that provider. (See Provider Data and Submission Object Data Elements: Provider(s) .) Programme Identifiers \u00b6 DEQAR will not synchronise data on programmes; however, if a local or national identifier is provided at the time of submission, this will be stored in the system. The agency can use the programme identifier if it would like to simply re-use the existing programme data for subsequent reports. It is thus recommended to provide a unique programme identifier if available. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Programme Identification .) Other Identifiers and Codes \u00b6 Countries are identified via the ISO 3166-1 standard . Both two-letter (alpha-2) or three-letter (alpha-3) codes can be used. As some EHEA countries consist of several sub-national higher education systems with separate legislation on higher education, those sub-systems are represented as distinct \u201ccountries\u201d in DEQAR to provide accurate system-level information. Sub-national systems have no alpha-3 code assigned but can be identified by the following non-standard extended alpha-2 codes: Code Country Sub-system BE-fl Belgium Flemish Community BE-fr Belgium French Community BE-de Belgium German-speaking Community UK-ENG United Kingdom England UK-SCT United Kingdom Scotland UK-WLS United Kingdom Wales UK-NIR United Kingdom Northern Ireland Language codes are accepted in ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2/B format . Finally, DEQAR provides DEQAR IDs for standard values used for Report Status and Report Decision . These can be provided instead of the equivalent string values in CSV or JSON objects. (See Submission Object Data Elements: Report Details .) Building Provider Records \u00b6 DEQAR has two basic workflows for creating and updating provider records: records on higher education institutions from most European countries are created and updated from the ETER/OrgReg databases (available through Research infrastructure for research and innovation policy studies - RISIS or European Tertiary Education Register - ETER ; records on higher education institutions located in countries not covered by ETER/OrgReg and records on other providers are created by EQAR from scratch based on data submitted by an agency. Providers Listed in ETER/OrgReg \u00b6 The European Tertiary Education Register (ETER) is a European-level database providing data on higher education institutions' (HEI) activities and outputs. ETER collects data from national statistics authorities and ministries in charge of higher education matters in Europe. Linked to ETER, the Register of Public Sector Organisations (OrgReg) provides a reference list of higher education institutions in all EU Member States, EEA-EFTA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), candidate countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia and Turkey) as well as the United Kingdom. DEQAR updates records from ETER/OrgReg every 24 hours. These records serve as base set of records on European higher education institutions in DEQAR. DEQAR stores the following ETER data on institutions: ETER ID official name English name acronym country city (when available) latitude/longitude (when available) QF-EHEA levels institution website ETER/OrgReg data is managed according to the following principles: DEQAR uses ETER/OrgReg data as a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d. If an agency would like to propose a correction or change of ETER/OrgReg-based data, the EQAR secretariat should be contacted. After reviewing, the EQAR Secretariat will make these changes in OrgReg and they will be reflected in DEQAR automatically afterwards. Alternative names and local identifiers may be added to ETER-based records and managed by agencies through the administrative interface (see Institution Identifiers above). Added information and updates in ETER/OrgReg are carried through to records in DEQAR from the next daily update. Providers Not in ETER/OrgReg \u00b6 For data not existing in ETER/OrgReg, a new record must be created based on data submitted by an agency. In the majority of cases these providers will be higher education institutions which are either based in countries not covered by ETER/OrgReg or other providers. In order to ensure data quality and avoid record duplication, provider data is always manually screened by EQAR staff and thus needs to be submitted separately, before reports are uploaded for an institution. The minimum data needed to create a record is: official name country where the provider is based provider website (URL) Provider data is managed as follows in this case: As a general policy, DEQAR keeps provider data, including those submitted directly by an agency, stable and unchanged. If an agency would like to propose a correction or change of data for more than 5 providers, we are inviting agencies to add the information on the changes in the tab \u201cUpdate institutions\u201d or \u201cUpdate other providers\u201d in the templates available here respectively and send it to deqar@eqar.eu . For changes of data on less than 5 providers, please contact the EQAR secretariat with a description of the change (i.e. a new name, closure date of the provider, new website etc.) at the above mentioned email address. Local identifiers may be added to any provider record and managed by agencies through the administrative interface (see Provider Identifiers above). The EQAR Secretariat reserves the right to adapt records based on the information that we receive through agencies and other sources. (See Provider Data Elements .) Hierarchical and Historical Provider Relationships \u00b6 In those cases when quality assurance reports are produced for different organisational levels of a provider , DEQAR collects and stores data on both entities and establishes a hierarchical link between them. This may be the case of a higher education institution and its \"child\" faculties, or of a provider and its \"parent\" group. Another example could be that a university found another provider through which it organises labour market focused short courses. In the public search interface, quality assurance reports produced for different levels in the same provider will cascade -- i.e. records on child providers will include the reports produced on the parents; records on parent providers will show the reports produced on its children. For higher education institutions, DEQAR bases its hierarchical links on information taken from ETER/OrgReg. If any agency would like to propose an additional structural link between two or more providers or institutional levels, then the proposed link can be provided individually or in a longer list to the EQAR secretariat. Please bear in mind that the main higher education institution unit is the university and that EQAR encourages agencies to upload reports under the university\u2019s record rather than the smaller units. Further information on the definition of higher education institutions can be found under defining institutions . DEQAR also stores information on historical changes in the structure of providers, e.g. mergers, splits, spin offs and absorptions . This allows users to view historical records in the correct context. It will also facilitate the search and discovery of current providers. Note: historical changes in the structure of agencies will also be stored and presented online. Presenting Historical Data \u00b6 DEQAR not only presents information on the recent ESG-compliant quality assurance activities, but also records an historical \"trail\" of the these activities since 2008, a date which marked the launch of EQAR. Thus DEQAR stores both current and past valid reports on each provider and both are presented to end users through the search interface. Historical data are especially important for DEQAR users from recognition offices or information centres. Agencies should thus upload information on all external QA procedures that were completed during their registration period, including those reports that are already \"expired\" and all external QA reports that are still valid. DEQAR also captures historical changes in the status, profile of agencies and providers, e.g. name changes, changed activity, physical relocation and changes in the organisational structure (see above ). Changes in the quality assurance regulations within EQAR countries are also captured. Historical data can be queried by end users, e.g. users can also find a provider under a previous name. Any request for an update to a provider record may be submitted to the EQAR secretariat for review. (It is part of the daily work of the EQAR secretariat to keep the registry of agencies and countries complete and up to date. Changes to the agency's activities, other than purely editorial or technical changes, must be made through Substantive Change Reports . Nevertheless, in case there is a concern about the recorded status, location or activities of a specific agency or of the quality assurance regime in a particular country, questions can also be directed to the EQAR secretariat.)","title":"Architecture and Data Model"},{"location":"architecture_data_model/#architecture-and-data-model","text":"","title":"Architecture and Data Model"},{"location":"architecture_data_model/#structural-overview","text":"The DEQAR data model has been designed around four main entities: registered quality assurance agencies , higher education providers , their educational programmes , and external quality assurance reports . erDiagram REPORT }o--|| \"AGENCY\" : \"belongs to\" REPORT ||--|{ \"REPORT FILE\" : has REPORT }o--|{ PROVIDER : \"focuses on\" REPORT ||--o{ PROGRAMME : \"may focus on\" Registered agency users are invited to submit and manage information on external quality assurance reports, including information about the particular programme described in the report, if applicable.

Hence, to ensure consistency and stability, DEQAR uses a set of standard identifiers, which are provided by the system for each object. In several cases, agencies are able to provide their local or national identifiers for objects in order to ease their internal workflows. Objects are identified in the following ways: Object Recommended Identification Alternative Identification Agency DEQAR Agency ID agency acronym Activity DEQAR Activity ID activity local identifier, activity name Reports local report identifier DEQAR Report ID Provider DEQARINST ID ETER ID, local identifier, other identifier Programme local programme identifier erDiagram REPORT { int DEQAR_report_id string local_identifier } AGENCY { int DEQAR_agency_id string agency_acronym } ACTIVITY { int DEQAR_activity_id string local_identifier string activity_name } PROVIDER { string DEQARINST_id string ETER_ID string local_identifier string other_identfiier } PROGRAMME { int DEQAR_programme_id string local_identifier } REPORT }o--|| AGENCY : \"belongs to\" REPORT }o--|| ACTIVITY : \"is part of\" REPORT }o--|{ PROVIDER : \"focuses on\" REPORT ||--o{ PROGRAMME : \"may focus on\" As a rule, objects already in the system should be identified to facilitate linking up. In other words: The agency responsible for the report and the activity to which it belongs must be identified with any submission . An identifier must be provided for each provider (higher education institution or other provider) covered by the report. If provider records do not yet exist in DEQAR, information on them must be provided separately before reports can be submitted. In the case of reports and programmes , agencies are encouraged to provide local identifiers with each new submission of data in order to facilitate subsequent linking: For reports, the agency can provide a local identifier with each new report submitted; the local identifier may be used to later update the report using CSV or JSON and may also help each agency to synchronise its local system with DEQAR. For programmes, the first time an agency provides information on a programme to DEQAR, a local (or national) identifier can be submitted along with data on the programme; the identifier can later be used by the agency for any report on the same programme. The identification of each type of object is explained in detail below.","title":"Role of Standards and Identifiers"},{"location":"architecture_data_model/#agency-identifiers","text":"Authentication is required before the submission and update of data and files.

In this case, the creating agency\u2019s unique acronym or DEQAR Agency ID (which can be found in the administrative interface) must be provided as the source of identification.

(They are also returned to the agency as part of the response object after each successful submission.) Ideally, each registered agency will store the DEQARINST IDs for providers treated in their reports. These are recommended for use in each submission. ETER IDs : DEQAR creates and updates records on higher education institutions from many European countries from the ETER/OrgReg database every 24 hours. The ETER ID for these institutions can be found through the administrative interface. The ETER IDs may be stored and used by agencies for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs. Local identifiers : Agencies may also create and store local identifiers for providers. These can be used for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs if supplied in advance. Each agency can provide these individually through the administrative interface or these can be provided in bulk to the EQAR Secretariat. Local identifiers are managed by one agency independently and can only be used by that agency. Other identifiers : DEQAR allows to store additional national, European or other identifiers. These can be used for submission as an alternative to the DEQARINST IDs and are available to all agencies; other identifiers available in the system can be consulted through the administrative interface. In order to ensure uniqueness and stability these are managed by the EQAR secretariat, but agencies are invited to provide identifiers to EQAR that might be useful to other agencies. Other identifiers are always used in combination with a resource indication, denoting the type of identifier, in combination with which they are unique. EQAR maintains a background list of other trusted identifiers . Agencies and other stakeholders can contact EQAR if they want to provide other identifiers. Note: If an agency cannot locate an existing provider record in DEQAR (and therefore cannot provide either the DEQARINST ID, ETER ID or local identifier), then it will need to provide data separately before being able to submit reports on that provider.

DEQAR updates records from ETER/OrgReg every 24 hours. These records serve as base set of records on European higher education institutions in DEQAR. DEQAR stores the following ETER data on institutions: ETER ID official name English name acronym country city (when available) latitude/longitude (when available) QF-EHEA levels institution website ETER/OrgReg data is managed according to the following principles: DEQAR uses ETER/OrgReg data as a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d. If an agency would like to propose a correction or change of ETER/OrgReg-based data, the EQAR secretariat should be contacted. After reviewing, the EQAR Secretariat will make these changes in OrgReg and they will be reflected in DEQAR automatically afterwards.

This may be the case of a higher education institution and its \"child\" faculties, or of a provider and its \"parent\" group. Another example could be that a university found another provider through which it organises labour market focused short courses. In the public search interface, quality assurance reports produced for different levels in the same provider will cascade -- i.e. records on child providers will include the reports produced on the parents; records on parent providers will show the reports produced on its children. For higher education institutions, DEQAR bases its hierarchical links on information taken from ETER/OrgReg. If any agency would like to propose an additional structural link between two or more providers or institutional levels, then the proposed link can be provided individually or in a longer list to the EQAR secretariat. Please bear in mind that the main higher education institution unit is the university and that EQAR encourages agencies to upload reports under the university\u2019s record rather than the smaller units. Further information on the definition of higher education institutions can be found under defining institutions . DEQAR also stores information on historical changes in the structure of providers, e.g. mergers, splits, spin offs and absorptions . This allows users to view historical records in the correct context. It will also facilitate the search and discovery of current providers. Note: historical changes in the structure of agencies will also be stored and presented online.","title":"Hierarchical and Historical Provider Relationships"},{"location":"architecture_data_model/#presenting-historical-data","text":"DEQAR not only presents information on the recent ESG-compliant quality assurance activities, but also records an historical \"trail\" of the these activities since 2008, a date which marked the launch of EQAR. Thus DEQAR stores both current and past valid reports on each provider and both are presented to end users through the search interface. Historical data are especially important for DEQAR users from recognition offices or information centres. Agencies should thus upload information on all external QA procedures that were completed during their registration period, including those reports that are already \"expired\" and all external QA reports that are still valid. DEQAR also captures historical changes in the status, profile of agencies and providers, e.g. name changes, changed activity, physical relocation and changes in the organisational structure (see above ). Changes in the quality assurance regulations within EQAR countries are also captured. Historical data can be queried by end users, e.g. users can also find a provider under a previous name. Any request for an update to a provider record may be submitted to the EQAR secretariat for review. (It is part of the daily work of the EQAR secretariat to keep the registry of agencies and countries complete and up to date. Changes to the agency's activities, other than purely editorial or technical changes, must be made through Substantive Change Reports .

Prepare your data with guidance on the Report Data Elements above. Submit data using your chosen submission method and review the response after your data has passed through validation and flagging as described in Data Pipeline below. Choosing a Submission Method \u00b6 Considering the various needs of the agencies, DEQAR supports three different submission methods. Their use is highly dependent on the technical resources available to a particular agency. Important: all three methods are fully interoperable. That is, agencies may switch between different methods at any time, and data submitted via one method may be updated/altered via another method. Webform : Those agencies needing a simple means of submitting report data to DEQAR can enter data directly in the webform present in the administrative interface. This method is fully manual; agencies can simply login and create new report records or modify existing ones. Flags and validation errors will be returned immediately upon submission. Data already submitted using CSV or JSON/API will also be accessible through the administrative interface. We recommend this method for agencies: without IT developers; with a closed system architecture from which data export is not straightforward; who would like to submit small amounts of data occasionally; who would like to interact with their DEQAR data directly. CSV Upload : In order to submit batches of documents, agencies may prefer to work with well-established formats like Excel. Comma Separated Values (CSV) is a flat file format which can be produced and presented directly through Excel, LibreOffce and many other software packages. This termed a semi-automatic data submission method. DEQAR has provided a CSV template which can be complemented with the detailed explanation of the Report Data Elements above. Using CSV, transformation of data can be done manually by administrative staff without the help of IT. Staff can then login to the administrative interface and upload the CSV file for import. When uploading, records (i.e. single lines of the file) are validated and information on the status of each record in the uploaded batch are shown on the import interface. Agency staff can then decide to fix failed records ad-hoc or re-upload them later. We recommend this method for agencies: without IT developers; with a local system from which they can export data in tables; who would like to submit bigger amounts of data in a batch; who would like to work manually on their data before submitting to DEQAR. Submission API : REST API is a convenient way for software developers to communicate via HTTP, the protocol used by the internet. When used together with the JSON format it provides flexible means of exchanging data between systems. With the possibility of sending complex request and response objects, DEQAR can accept structured data and give immediate feedbacks (error checks, warnings) about the submitted data as well as metadata enhancements. We recommend this method for agencies: with IT developers / IT vendors who can develop a method (script/web application) to post data to the API endpoint; who would like to submit large amounts of data at once with a single call; who would like to submit individual reports immediately upon their creation; who would like to keep DEQAR and their local system in sync; who plan to submit data periodically and at longer intervals (e.g. weekly or monthly). Data Pipeline \u00b6 In general, irrespective of the submission method, all report data submitted to DEQAR is handled following these steps: The first level of validation concerns the data format, including that all required fields are present and all identifiers used are valid. If the record does not pass the requirements and constraints described in Validation Criteria below, the record is rejected. Valid report data is saved in the database. Sanity checks are run against pre-defined Flagging Criteria ; reports which meet any of these criteria are flagged. Flagged reports are nevertheless saved in the database and should not be re-submitted. A Response Object (or array of objects) is sent back to the agency, containing: detailed error descriptions for report objects that were rejected; identifiers of report records that were created or identified; information on records where sanity checks found issues. Validation criteria \u00b6 In order for submission objects to clear the first level of validation, they must meet the following criteria: The main agency that created the report (which may or may not be the agency submitting the records) must be clearly identified and, if your user is not linked to the agency itself, you must have a proxy to submit reports for the agency. Additional, contributing agencies can be identified , but all validation and flagging criteria relate to the main agency only. Submitted data must align with the Agency Profile information, specifically report validity date must be after the Agency's EQAR registration start date and before the registration end date, if applicable. All required data must be present for each report. Required data for all records includes: ESG activity performed Status of report Decision Report valid from date, including date format used by the agency At least one report file including the language(s) in which it is drafted Organisation: a report must relate to at least one existing organisation record identified by a DEQARINST ID, ETER ID or another known identifier. At this point, dependencies between elements will be checked as well as any limits on the number of values permitted for each element. In particular: Requirements based on the type of ESG activity : institutional: no programme data must be provided programme or programme/institution: exactly one organisation must be identified, data on one or several programme(s) must be provided joint programme: at least two organisations must be identified, data on one or several programme(s) must be provided Data required for each programme (i.e. except institutional reports): the programme name (in whichever language it is stored by the Agency) the degree outcome indicating whether full degree or not \u2013 required as from 2024 the qualification level \u2013 required for non-full degree programmes, as from 2024 required for all Data required for programmes with degree outcome \"no\" (= not leading to a full degree): Workload expressed in ECTS Whether programme includes assessment or certification Constraints for reports not covering any higher education institution from the EHEA , e.g. report on a non-European higher education institution or other provider: Status must be \"voluntary\" Constraints for reports on only other providers , i.e. when none of the organisations identified is a higher education institution: Degree outcome must be \"no\" (= not leading to a full recognised degree) Submitted data must be of the correct type, form and value range/options as described above. Records not meeting all of the above criteria will be rejected and no data on the report will be saved. The system will return a response object that clearly identifies rejected records, including information on the source of the problem. Importantly, the rejection of one or more submission objects does not imply the failure of the whole submission batch. Flagging criteria \u00b6 Once the report data passed the first level of validation, DEQAR report records are created or updated with the submitted data. Now, some final sanity checks are run on the records: records may receive a \u201clow-level flag\u201d or a \u201chigh-level flag\u201d. In the first case, records will appear online with submitted data, while the EQAR Secretariat is informed to take note. In the second case, records will not be published until they have been checked and confirmed by the EQAR Secretariat. The purpose of a flag is to bring a report to the EQAR Secretariat's attention. A flag normally does not indicate that data should be changed. Therefore, provided that the data you entered/uploaded is correct, please do not try to change the data of a report in order to prevent it from being flagged, but simply wait for EQAR Secretariat to have checked the report. Sanity checks may result in high-level flags for the following reason: Report Status is listed as part of obligatory EQA system and the Agency does not have official status (according to EQAR's information) in any legal seat country of any higher education covered by the report. For reports on both higher education institutions and other providers, the agency must have official status in one of the higher education institutions' countries, the status in the other providers' countries is not relevant to this check. Sanity checks may result in low-level flags for the following reasons: The report covers a provider with a legal seat in or a programme delivered in a country in which the agency has not previously been active. Country of the programme (if specified) does not match any location country of any provider covered. Programme-level report is \"voluntary\" and the programme's qualification level is not contained in the list of qualification levels of any of the higher education institutions specified One or more PDF files of the report could not be downloaded (in case a URL was specified) or was not yet uploaded (using the specific API endpoint) In addition, the following data on agencies or institutions will automatically be complemented at flagging stage: If the report covers a provider with a legal seat in or a programme delivered in a country in which the agency has not previously been active, this country is added to the agency's profile . The programme qualification level is added to a higher education institution's qualification levels if the report is \"part of the obligatory EQA system\". The programme qualification level is always added to an other provider's qualification levels. Webform \u00b6 The DEQAR administrative interface includes an interactive webform, allowing you to submit single reports. The administrative interface is available at: location: https://admin.deqar.eu/ username: [agency's acronym (in lower case)] password: [your personal password] If you do not remember your password or did not change the default password, please go to https://admin.deqar.eu/forgot-password in order to reset your password. You need to enter your email address and will receive by email a special link that allows you to set a new password. The email address linked to your login is the same email address to which submission report emails are sent. If you do not remember which email address is linked to your agency's login, please contact the EQAR Secretariat. The webform can be found in the menu under Submit Report > Report Form . Required fields are marked with a * in the form; fields marked with a (*) are conditionally required. Please note that the Activity chosen might influence which information is required (see Report Data Elements above). The Save Record button becomes active once all required information has been provided. We strongly recommend that you provide a Local Report Identifier that identifies the specific report in your own information system or workflow, even when you use the webform. This will facilitate later updates should they be necessary, and can be useful if your agency changes to CSV upload or the Submission API later on. You can select institutions using the search box. If you are uploading a report on an institution that has no DEQAR record yet, see Institution Data on how to add it before uploading reports. Data on programmes will only be needed if your report results from a programme-level activity. Fill the form with the required information and then click the Add Programme button. If the report concerns several programmes (e.g. clustered evaluation) please repeat the step for all programmes concerned. (See Programme Data Elements above.) Each report may contain one or more report files (for example, the experts' report, a possible summary report and the decision taken might be contained all in one or in separate files). The report file fields are conditionally required. At least one must be present, but agencies can either provide a URL or upload a file directly (in either case, only PDF files are accepted). For each file, please specify the language(s) of its contents. The display name is optional; the text \"Report\" will be used as a default otherwise. (See QA Report Files above.) CSV Upload \u00b6 Comma-separated values (CSV) is a common and interoperable data-exchange format. Files can be imported and exported from all usual spreadsheet software (e.g. Excel, LibreOffice, ...) and numerous other applications. The first row of your file is a header which should include column names as defined under Report Data Elements above. The following lines contain one report per row. A simple example of a CSV first-fow header for institution-level reports could look as follows: agency, activity, status, decision, valid_from, valid_to, date_format, file[1].original_location, file[1].report_language[1], institution[1].eter_id (Spaces added for readability, these should not appear in an actual file.) One report may often include/relate to several items, such as one or more provider(s), programmes or one or more files--some in several languages. In those cases you will find field names of the type field_name[n] (See Report Data Elements above). You should create as many columns as you need and replace n by 1, 2, ... For example, two files (e.g. full report in local language, and summary in both English and local language) can be provided as follows: ..., file[1].original_location, file[1].display_name, file[1].report_language[1], file[2].original_location, file[2].display_name, file[2].report_language[1], file[2].report_language[2], ... ..., \"http://some.url/to/report\", \"Expert report\", \"de\", \"http://some.url/to/report\", \"Summary\", \"en\", \"de\", ... (Spaces added for readability, these should not appear in an actual file.) You can use one of the sample CSV files below as a starting point and adjust it to your needs. Please bear in mind the following: The template file is provided in Microsoft Excel and Open Document Formats, as well as viewable on-line. It needs to be saved in CSV format for upload to DEQAR (see notes below). The first worksheet includes all possible column names you could use in a CSV file, with the respective requirement/validation notes as comments. These comments will disappear as you save the file in CSV format. The subsequent worksheets include more condensed examples with sample data, including those columns that will typically be used in reports concerning institutions, programmes or joint programmes. You need to include all columns you might need in at least one of your reports, but they can stay empty in those lines where they are not applicable. You may omit columns from the sample CSV file that are not used in any of the reports. CSV files should be saved in UTF-8 encoding. Template and samples \u00b6 Microsoft Excel format Open Document Format (OpenOffice/LibreOffice/NeoOffice) Sample in CSV format (without comments) Preparing/exporting CSV files \u00b6 Despite being software-independent, there are some known issues when creating/exporting CSV files from some major office applications. Given that it has the most clean and straight-forward CSV export, we recommend the LibreOffice package , a free and open-source desktop application supported on all major operating systems. For all software packages, please note that the CSV format does not support multiple sheets, but it will always be only the current work sheet that is saved in CSV format. Microsoft Excel \u00b6 Despite offering CSV as a target file type in its Save as dialogue, Microsoft Excel does not create correct CSV files when certain character sets are used (e.g. Greek or Cyrillic alphabets, or certain Roman characters with diacritics). You can use the following work-around: Select Save as from the File menu, select your desired folder and choose Unicode Text (*.txt) as type. Simply press OK in response to the following error message: Furthermore, confirm with Yes also the following warning message: Close Microsoft Excel and navigate to the folder containing your file in the file manager. Right-click on your file and choose Rename . Now change the file extension from .txt into .csv . You will encounter the following message: If you change file name extension, the file may become unusable. You still want to change them, you should press \u2018Yes\u2019... Confirm the warning by clicking Yes. This CSV file is now suitable for upload. LibreOffice/OpenOffice/NeoOffice \u00b6 Exporting CSV files is straight-forward in LibreOffice, OpenOffice and NeoOffice: Choose Text CSV (*.csv) as file type in the Save As ... or Save a Copy ... dialogue: Ensure the export settings are set as follows in the next dialogue. Please pay particular attention character set and delimiters: The CSV file is now suitable for upload. Google Sheets \u00b6 In Google Sheets, choose Comma-separated values from the File > Download as... menu. Uploading CSV files \u00b6 The CSV upload module is part of the DEQAR admin interface: location: https://admin.deqar.eu/upload-csv username: [agency's acronym (in lower case)] password: [your personal password] (see above how to reset your password) Select Submit Report > Upload CSV from the menu. Choose your file under Select CSV file and click Upload . You can now review your data one more time under Uploaded CSV Data , and make changes if necessary. Afterwards, click on Ingest under the table. The uploaded CSV file now passes the same validation pipeline as information submitted through any other method. After ingest, you will see all rows highlighted in green if they were successfully saved, or in red if they could not be ingested due to validation errors. Click on a row to see details about the errors. If you experienced errors, you can correct the respective lines and click on Ingest again. Please note that the green rows will be re-ingested, but overwrite the existing report based on the DEQAR Report ID. Any changes you make to green rows will therefore be recorded on a further ingest, too. Submission API \u00b6 REST API is a convenient way for software developers to communicate with web services via HTTP, the protocol used by the internet. Together with JSON it provides an easy, straightforward and flexible means of exchanging data between systems. With the possibility of sending complex request and response objects, we can accept structured data and give immediate feedbacks (e.g. error checks, warnings) about the submitted data as well as metadata enhancements (e.g. ETER IDs on HEIs, when applicable; links to new records on the EQAR public interface, etc.). Authentication \u00b6 Requests for submission to DEQAR are only accepted from registered users and must therefore be identified. DEQAR API endpoints manage authentication using API Tokens (through the so-called Bearer Authentication method). Upon registration, an API Token (which is basically a hash) is created for each user. Sending this token in the Authorization header (with type/scheme Bearer) will authenticate the user in place of a regular username and password. To get your authentication token you can send a POST request to the following URL: https://backend.deqar.eu/accounts/get_token/ An example of obtaining a token using curl in command line: curl -s -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -XPOST https://backend.deqar.eu/accounts/get_token/ --data '{\"username\":\"testuser\",\"password\":\"testpassword\"}' The username is the agency\u2019s acronym (in lower case).

The Submission Request Object is the JSON object (or array of objects) which is the manifestation of a report or set of reports an agency wants to submit. Fields and accepted types are as described in Report Data Elements above. The full definition of request and response objects can be find in OpenAPI format under: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/swagger/ Important: Please do not include institution data (such as name, location, etc.) in your Submission Request Object. The corresponding fields are deprecated and will be removed in version 2 of the Submission API. Identify institutions by one single identifier only (DEQARINST ID, ETER ID, local or other identifier). New institutions must be added separately beforehand . Report File Submission Endpoint \u00b6 Files (PDF versions of reports) can be submitted in two separate ways: URLs submitted with a Submission Request Object will be harvested asynchronously upon successful submission. Files can be submitted directly to a dedicated endpoint as part of a PUT request: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/reportfile/<report_file_id>/<filename> report_file_id : The id number of the Report File object available in the response after successful submission. The report_file_id is contained in the response object of the successful report submission. filename : The name of the file that you will submit in this request.

Changing or updating reports in DEQAR should therefore be the exception, rather than regular practice. Reports can, however, be changed if needed as follows: Manually via admin interface Please find the report that you want to change in the admin interface, under under Reference data > Reports. To narrow down the search, use filters and search by report number, name, year, agency, country, activity type and flag. Once you find the report, open the record and click on Edit Report. When submitting, please leave a short note to explain the changes you made. Submission API or CSV Upload Please use the same method/template as for initially uploading reports. Use either the DEQAR Report ID ( report_id ) or the same Local Report Identifier ( local_identifier ) that you provided to DEQAR with your earlier/initial upload of the report. Lacking an ID prevents the system from recognising the report that needs to be updated, and will lead to creation of new (duplicate) record in the database, not overwriting. As the system replaces the entire record, you must provide the full submission object once again, including all fields and not just the altered ones. Failing to provide information in required fields will lead to rejection of the change, and the old record will remain. Failing to provide information in optional fields will empty those fields, even if they were filled before, and will thus cause deletion of the information. Sandbox \u00b6 The DEQAR Sandbox, like any sandbox, is intended for you to \u201cplay\u201d, enabling you to trial particular submission methods, data structures, formats and syntax. More specifically, it is a space where we encourage (even urge) you to test your submissions before putting them into the live system. The Sandbox is reached through separate links: To test the manual and CSV submission, go to the Sandbox Administrative Interface at: https://admin.sandbox.deqar.eu/ To test API submission, go to the Sandbox Submission API at: https://backend.sandbox.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report To see what your records will eventually look like on the public site, go to the Sandbox Public Interface at: https://sandbox.deqar.eu/ The Sandbox is an identical copy of the live system. The entire data of the live site is copied over to the Sandbox every night. Thus, your login and password are the same as in your DEQAR account\u2014unless you have made changes within the last 24 hours. You can also reset or change your password in the Sandbox, but it will be overwritten by the next day.","title":"Report Submission"},{"location":"data_submission/#report-submission","text":"Each agency should follow three steps to submit their report data: Choose a particular submission method . Prepare your data with guidance on the Report Data Elements above. Submit data using your chosen submission method and review the response after your data has passed through validation and flagging as described in Data Pipeline below.","title":"Report Submission"},{"location":"data_submission/#choosing-a-submission-method","text":"Considering the various needs of the agencies, DEQAR supports three different submission methods. Their use is highly dependent on the technical resources available to a particular agency. Important: all three methods are fully interoperable. That is, agencies may switch between different methods at any time, and data submitted via one method may be updated/altered via another method. Webform : Those agencies needing a simple means of submitting report data to DEQAR can enter data directly in the webform present in the administrative interface. This method is fully manual; agencies can simply login and create new report records or modify existing ones. Flags and validation errors will be returned immediately upon submission. Data already submitted using CSV or JSON/API will also be accessible through the administrative interface. We recommend this method for agencies: without IT developers; with a closed system architecture from which data export is not straightforward; who would like to submit small amounts of data occasionally; who would like to interact with their DEQAR data directly. CSV Upload : In order to submit batches of documents, agencies may prefer to work with well-established formats like Excel. Comma Separated Values (CSV) is a flat file format which can be produced and presented directly through Excel, LibreOffce and many other software packages. This termed a semi-automatic data submission method. DEQAR has provided a CSV template which can be complemented with the detailed explanation of the Report Data Elements above. Using CSV, transformation of data can be done manually by administrative staff without the help of IT. Staff can then login to the administrative interface and upload the CSV file for import. When uploading, records (i.e. single lines of the file) are validated and information on the status of each record in the uploaded batch are shown on the import interface. Agency staff can then decide to fix failed records ad-hoc or re-upload them later. We recommend this method for agencies: without IT developers; with a local system from which they can export data in tables; who would like to submit bigger amounts of data in a batch; who would like to work manually on their data before submitting to DEQAR. Submission API : REST API is a convenient way for software developers to communicate via HTTP, the protocol used by the internet. When used together with the JSON format it provides flexible means of exchanging data between systems. With the possibility of sending complex request and response objects, DEQAR can accept structured data and give immediate feedbacks (error checks, warnings) about the submitted data as well as metadata enhancements. We recommend this method for agencies: with IT developers / IT vendors who can develop a method (script/web application) to post data to the API endpoint; who would like to submit large amounts of data at once with a single call; who would like to submit individual reports immediately upon their creation; who would like to keep DEQAR and their local system in sync; who plan to submit data periodically and at longer intervals (e.g. weekly or monthly).","title":"Choosing a Submission Method"},{"location":"data_submission/#data-pipeline","text":"In general, irrespective of the submission method, all report data submitted to DEQAR is handled following these steps: The first level of validation concerns the data format, including that all required fields are present and all identifiers used are valid. If the record does not pass the requirements and constraints described in Validation Criteria below, the record is rejected. Valid report data is saved in the database. Sanity checks are run against pre-defined Flagging Criteria ; reports which meet any of these criteria are flagged. Flagged reports are nevertheless saved in the database and should not be re-submitted. A Response Object (or array of objects) is sent back to the agency, containing: detailed error descriptions for report objects that were rejected; identifiers of report records that were created or identified; information on records where sanity checks found issues.","title":"Data Pipeline"},{"location":"data_submission/#validation-criteria","text":"In order for submission objects to clear the first level of validation, they must meet the following criteria: The main agency that created the report (which may or may not be the agency submitting the records) must be clearly identified and, if your user is not linked to the agency itself, you must have a proxy to submit reports for the agency. Additional, contributing agencies can be identified , but all validation and flagging criteria relate to the main agency only. Submitted data must align with the Agency Profile information, specifically report validity date must be after the Agency's EQAR registration start date and before the registration end date, if applicable. All required data must be present for each report. Required data for all records includes: ESG activity performed Status of report Decision Report valid from date, including date format used by the agency At least one report file including the language(s) in which it is drafted Organisation: a report must relate to at least one existing organisation record identified by a DEQARINST ID, ETER ID or another known identifier. At this point, dependencies between elements will be checked as well as any limits on the number of values permitted for each element. In particular: Requirements based on the type of ESG activity : institutional: no programme data must be provided programme or programme/institution: exactly one organisation must be identified, data on one or several programme(s) must be provided joint programme: at least two organisations must be identified, data on one or several programme(s) must be provided Data required for each programme (i.e. except institutional reports): the programme name (in whichever language it is stored by the Agency) the degree outcome indicating whether full degree or not \u2013 required as from 2024 the qualification level \u2013 required for non-full degree programmes, as from 2024 required for all Data required for programmes with degree outcome \"no\" (= not leading to a full degree): Workload expressed in ECTS Whether programme includes assessment or certification Constraints for reports not covering any higher education institution from the EHEA , e.g. report on a non-European higher education institution or other provider: Status must be \"voluntary\" Constraints for reports on only other providers , i.e. when none of the organisations identified is a higher education institution: Degree outcome must be \"no\" (= not leading to a full recognised degree) Submitted data must be of the correct type, form and value range/options as described above. Records not meeting all of the above criteria will be rejected and no data on the report will be saved. The system will return a response object that clearly identifies rejected records, including information on the source of the problem. Importantly, the rejection of one or more submission objects does not imply the failure of the whole submission batch.","title":"Validation criteria"},{"location":"data_submission/#flagging-criteria","text":"Once the report data passed the first level of validation, DEQAR report records are created or updated with the submitted data. Now, some final sanity checks are run on the records: records may receive a \u201clow-level flag\u201d or a \u201chigh-level flag\u201d. In the first case, records will appear online with submitted data, while the EQAR Secretariat is informed to take note. In the second case, records will not be published until they have been checked and confirmed by the EQAR Secretariat. The purpose of a flag is to bring a report to the EQAR Secretariat's attention. A flag normally does not indicate that data should be changed. Therefore, provided that the data you entered/uploaded is correct, please do not try to change the data of a report in order to prevent it from being flagged, but simply wait for EQAR Secretariat to have checked the report. Sanity checks may result in high-level flags for the following reason: Report Status is listed as part of obligatory EQA system and the Agency does not have official status (according to EQAR's information) in any legal seat country of any higher education covered by the report. For reports on both higher education institutions and other providers, the agency must have official status in one of the higher education institutions' countries, the status in the other providers' countries is not relevant to this check. Sanity checks may result in low-level flags for the following reasons: The report covers a provider with a legal seat in or a programme delivered in a country in which the agency has not previously been active. Country of the programme (if specified) does not match any location country of any provider covered. Programme-level report is \"voluntary\" and the programme's qualification level is not contained in the list of qualification levels of any of the higher education institutions specified One or more PDF files of the report could not be downloaded (in case a URL was specified) or was not yet uploaded (using the specific API endpoint) In addition, the following data on agencies or institutions will automatically be complemented at flagging stage: If the report covers a provider with a legal seat in or a programme delivered in a country in which the agency has not previously been active, this country is added to the agency's profile . The programme qualification level is added to a higher education institution's qualification levels if the report is \"part of the obligatory EQA system\". The programme qualification level is always added to an other provider's qualification levels.","title":"Flagging criteria"},{"location":"data_submission/#webform","text":"The DEQAR administrative interface includes an interactive webform, allowing you to submit single reports.

Required fields are marked with a * in the form; fields marked with a (*) are conditionally required. Please note that the Activity chosen might influence which information is required (see Report Data Elements above). The Save Record button becomes active once all required information has been provided. We strongly recommend that you provide a Local Report Identifier that identifies the specific report in your own information system or workflow, even when you use the webform. This will facilitate later updates should they be necessary, and can be useful if your agency changes to CSV upload or the Submission API later on. You can select institutions using the search box.

Changing or updating reports in DEQAR should therefore be the exception, rather than regular practice. Reports can, however, be changed if needed as follows: Manually via admin interface Please find the report that you want to change in the admin interface, under under Reference data > Reports. To narrow down the search, use filters and search by report number, name, year, agency, country, activity type and flag. Once you find the report, open the record and click on Edit Report. When submitting, please leave a short note to explain the changes you made. Submission API or CSV Upload Please use the same method/template as for initially uploading reports. Use either the DEQAR Report ID ( report_id ) or the same Local Report Identifier ( local_identifier ) that you provided to DEQAR with your earlier/initial upload of the report. Lacking an ID prevents the system from recognising the report that needs to be updated, and will lead to creation of new (duplicate) record in the database, not overwriting. As the system replaces the entire record, you must provide the full submission object once again, including all fields and not just the altered ones.

If a record already exists in DEQAR, the provider needs to be identified; otherwise, the provider must be created before a report can be submitted. Providers in DEQAR \u00b6 DEQAR distinguishes two types of providers - higher education institutions and other providers. DEQAR only registers providers which provide learning opportunities at the QF-EHEA Levels (equivalent to EQF and ISCED levels 5 to 8). Vocational education and training provisions at EHEA QF level 5 which are not considered as higher education in the national systems are not included. The main difference between the two types of providers is whether the entity has full degree awarding powers or not. The number of programmes for which the provider has awarding powers, the subject area and the mode of delivery of the programme are not important for the differentiation. Higher education institution Other provider QF-EHEA short to PhD/EQF Levels 5-8 Yes Yes Short programmes (<60 ECTS) Yes, optionally Yes Programmes leading to full degree (short, bachelor, master, PhD degree) Yes No Programmes leading to other types of certificates (e.g. nano or micro degree, badges etc.) Yes Yes Agencies are advised to consult with the EQAR Secretariat at deqar@eqar.eu in case they are in doubt about the nature of the provider. Should this be the case, agencies are encouraged to share materials on the provider, and any other evidence that could help EQAR in concluding the status. Finding Existing Providers \u00b6 Existing providers need to be identified by their DEQARINST ID, ETER ID (for higher education institutions), another international identifier, or a local or national identifier (if available). DEQAR has records on a large number of higher education institutions (over 4000 institutions from 42 European countries) harvested from the ETER/OrgReg databases (available through Research infrastructure for research and innovation policy studies - RISIS or European Tertiary Education Register - ETER ). More than 2000 additional providers are already recorded in DEQAR based on other official sources (e.g. lists by national ministries) or have been added by other agencies. Admin Interface \u00b6 All provider identifiers can be found through the administrative interface . Important: The public DEQAR website does not show all providers, but only those for which at least one report is available. It is therefore important that you always search for providers in the administrative interface , as DEQAR contains records on several hundreds of higher education institutions and a few other providers for which no reports have been submitted yet. Reports on existing providers can be submitted directly, providing identifiers in CSV or JSON objects as described under Submission Object Data Elements: Institution(s) or by selecting the provider in the web form. Download CSV File \u00b6 The full list of providers can also be downloaded as a CSV file from: https://www.eqar.eu/qa-results/download-data-sets/ Connect API \u00b6 The full providers list can be searched and accessed using the Connect API. EQAR-registered agencies have access to the Connect API using the same credentials as for the DEQAR administrative interface, the Submission API and the Web API. Please refer to the explanations on authentication for the Submission API for information on how to obtain and use a token. The base URL for the Connect API is: https://backend.deqar.eu/connectapi/v1 The endpoint https://backend.deqar.eu/connectapi/v1/institutions/ allows to query the full list of higher education institutions, with or without reports. The endpoint https://backend.deqar.eu/connectapi/v1/providers/ allows to query the full list of all providers, with or without reports. The list can be filtered by type of provider, i.e. higher education institutions and other providers. The full definitions of the endpoints, the search parameters and the response object are available as OpenAPI Specification 3.0 at: https://backend.deqar.eu/connectapi/v1/swagger/ To retrieve the details on a single provider, please use the Web API endpoint . Defining Higher Education Institutions \u00b6 Before suggesting to add a new higher education institution, please consider the following notes: DEQAR mainly follows European Tertiary Education Register's (ETER) data model and coverage . The primary unit of registration is the university/higher education institution, i.e. an institution of higher learning that awards full recognised academic degrees in diverse disciplines, is organised as central unit and consists of separate functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments). The degree-awarding powers of the institution are recognised by at least one national authority. Functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments) themselves are not registered in DEQAR as separate entities. Reports on functional units are uploaded/recorded/shown under the central unit's record. Reports on consortia consisting of several providers will be showcased in the record of each provider separately. Consortia themselves will not be presented as a central unit. Only in exceptional cases, when the consortium has a long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as an institution itself, will it be registered as a separate institution in DEQAR; such cases are to be discussed with the EQAR Secretariat in advance. Reports on institutions' branches and campuses, home and abroad, will be showcased in the record of the central institution (i.e. the university), while such additional branches/campuses will be shown as further locations of the institution. Only in exceptional cases, where the branch/campus has a proven long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as a semi-independent institution, will it be registered in DEQAR. Providers that award full recognised degrees through a franchise or validation partnership with a higher education institution, but have no own degree-awarding power, will be recorded as other provider. A hierarchical relationship to the partner higher education institution should be recorded for transparency. In cases when the status of the entity is not clearly determined by the aforementioned cases or the status is debatable, EQAR and the agency will discuss the nature of it taking into account five main indicators: legal status provideral independence financial independence stakeholders\u2019 perceptions local context and approaches to higher education Defining Other Providers \u00b6 In DEQAR, \"other provider\" is a provider that delivers content or provides skills training: At higher education level (i.e. EHEA QF level 5 to 8; EQF 5 to 8; EHEA cycle short to third) Does not have a full degree awarding powers (i.e. right to award bachelor, master or PhD degrees) The mode of delivery of the classes, whether the provision is done independently or in partnership with a higher education institution, the ownership of the provider (e.g. private or public provider), the connection to the labour market and the area of study are not defining elements of \"other providers\" in DEQAR. Reports for programmes offered in collaboration by a higher education institution and another provider will be showcased under both entities respectively. Similarly, a provider that offers education programmes under a franchise or validation agreement with a higher education institution would be considered as \"other provider\", whereas the franchise/validation partnership would be reflected as a linkage with the HEI concerned. Provider Data Elements \u00b6 If a record for a provider does not already exist in DEQAR it should be described with the elements below; required elements are marked in bold or by a * .

If no romanised form is stored locally, then ISO romanisation standards can be used to created romanised forms. If transliteration is not provided, access to the provider record through the search interface will be more limited. For those languages included in the Python transliterate package transliterations can be generated automatically when supplying provider data in bulk . e.g. Yugo-zapaden universitet \"Neofit Rilski\u201d e.g. Plirophor\u00edes yia tous allodapo\u00fas phitit\u00e9s: \u00cdsodos kai progr\u00e1mmata English Name ( name_english ; recommended; string) A single English provider name should be provided for any provider without an English official name. If provided, the English name will be used as the primary name for display in the DEQAR interface; the search, however, always matches against all name versions/variations. While not required, providing an English name is strongly recommended to enhance the user experience. e.g. South-West University \"Neofit Rilski\", Blagoevgrad Provider Acronym ( acronym ; not required; string) The official acronym for each provider may be provided. This will be indexed for search. It should thus be provided especially where it is commonly used to refer to the institution, so that it can be found more easily. e.g. SWU e.g. BOKU Location \u00b6 One or more locations must be provided for each new provider record. A location is provided as a combination of a country and a city name along with an optional latitude and longitude. Each provider must have one and only one location designated as main legal seat. For higher education institutions, the legal seat is considered as the higher education system in which the institution is formally recognised. In case an institution is a legal entity incorporated in country A but formally recognised as higher education institution in system B, the legal seat should be specified in B. In case a higher education institution is formally recognised in several higher education systems, separate provider records should be created, one for each system. For other providers, the legal seat is considered as the country in which the legal entity is incorporated. For providers with multiple seats (e.g. branches), each of the locations (i.e. country and city) could be provided in a separate column with number in the brackets ( [n] ). The first country (i.e. country_id) will be considered as the main legal seat of the provider. Provider Legal Seat Country* ( country_id ; required; string) The country where each provider has its legal seat (see above) must be provided for every new provider record. Each country must be provided using either an ISO 3166 alpha2 or ISO 3166 alpha3 country code (see ISO 3166-1 standard ), or using the DEQAR numerical ID. Provider countries will be indexed for search. e.g. BG e.g. BGR Provider Legal Seat City* ( city ; required; string) The city name, preferably in English, where the provider has its legal seat may be provided for each provider record. If a provider is located in more than one city, further cities can be provided as other locations (see below). e.g. Sofia Provider Legal Seat Postcode* ( postcode ; conditionally required; string) The postcode of the provider's legal seat. This field is required for higher education institution in systems covered by OrgReg/ETER. e.g. 1030 Provider Legal Seat Latitude ( latitude ; not required; float) Provider Legal Seat Longitude ( longitude ; not required; float) The exact latitude and longitude of the organisation site or the general latitude and longitude of the city may also be provided for each provider record. e.g. 48,208,356; 1,636,776 If the provider has further locations in the same or other countries, the agency may provide further information. In the CSV file, each additional location should be presented in a new column with the subsequent number in brackets (i.e. [n+1] ). The following set of columns can be copied for each additional location: Other Location Country ( other_location[n].country ; not required; string) Other Location City ( other_location[n].city ; not required; string) Other Location Postcode ( other_location[n].postcode ; conditionally required; string) Other Location Latitude ( other_location[n].latitude ; not required; float) Other Location Longitude ( other_location[n].longitude ; not required; float) The format and requirements are identical to the corresponding fields above. Qualification Level \u00b6 The provider QF-EHEA levels may be provided for higher education institutions and must be provided for other providers. Provider Qualification Level ( qf_ehea_level[n] ; conditionally required; string) One or more qualification levels may be provided for higher education institutions and must be provided for other providers as either a DEQAR level name or a DEQAR level id. DEQAR uses levels based on three main frameworks/classifications: Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area (QF EHEA level), European Qualification Framework (EQF) and International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). These are the qualification framework levels at which each higher education institution may award degrees or offer programmes (for other providers). Note: if QF levels are provided, then all levels covered by the provider should be provided at the same time. In the CSV template, each level can be presented as ONE of the possible numbers OR words. Each additional level should be presented in a new column with the subsequent number in brackets (i.e. [n+1] ). ID (QF-EHEA level) ID (EQF level, ISCED level) name (QF-EHEA level) 0 5 short cycle 1 6 first cycle 2 7 second cycle 3 8 third cycle Website \u00b6 Exactly one website link must be provided for each new provider record. Provider Website (*) ( website_link ; required; string) The URL to the primary provider website or home page. The root domain name of the site should be used when possible, without language or other qualifiers. e.g. http://www.swu.bg e.g. https://qualifications.pearson.com/ Identifier \u00b6 Providing an identifier serves as proof of confirming the validity of the provider and aiding the users to find providers easily in other databases. The identifier can be used later to identify this provider in the report submission objects. A local identifier may be provided for the providers. Local identifiers are for use by your agency only, whereas other identifiers can be used also by others. Other identifiers may be provided for higher education institutions in OrgReg and must be provided for higher education institutions which are not in OrgReg and for all other providers. For higher education institutions, it is strongly recommended to provide the institution's identifier in the IAU/UNESCO World Higher Education Database (WHED) . Institutions listed in WHED are confirmed to be nationally-recognised higher education institutions. If a WHED identifier is provided the institution is thus accepted automatically. If no WHED identifier is provided, additional proof of the institution's official status is required , see below. EQAR runs a background list of other trusted identifiers presented below. For other providers based in the European Union, agencies are expected to submit the EU - VAT number as identifier. Provider Identifier ( identifier ; conditionally required; string) Please note that identifiers must be unique within your agency or within the resource provided. e.g. HCERES21 Identifier Resource ( identifier_resource ; conditionally required; string) If the identifier is not a local identifier of your agency, you must provide a short label designating the resource in order to distinguish it from other identifiers. As the resource tag needs to be used consistently, and the combination of identifier and resource tag needs to be globally unique in DEQAR, it should be communicated with the EQAR secretariat. e.g. DE-HRK Identifier Source ( identifier_source ; conditionally required; string) The agency must provide other identifiers for higher education institutions which are not in OrgReg and for all other providers. The field must be filled in if the identifier is not yet known to EQAR (see table below for trusted identifiers). The source can be a national authority, an international provider or another entity. If the identifier is already known to EQAR (see table), there is no need to fill this field. e.g. World Higher Education Database Proof of Status ( proof_of_status ; conditionally required; string) If the higher education institution is not listed in WHED, or the agency does not provide the WHED identifier, an official source must be provided to proof that the institution indeed has full degree awarding powers in at least one higher education system. The source could be the website of the ministry responsible for higher education, an official national register of higher education institutions or similar. Please note that a link to the institution's own website is not accepted as official source . e.g. https://www.gov.si/teme/evs-evidenca-visokosolskih-zavodov-in-studijskih-programov/ The following common European or international identifier types are known in DEQAR and can be used without additional information, i.e. it is sufficient to provide the identifier resource, the identifier source does not need to be specified.

Founding date ( founding_date ; not required; date) Closing date ( closing_date ; conditionally required; date) Dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD and years should be given in four digits ( YYYY ). The closing date must be provided if the provider has closed its operation. e.g. 2020-07-01 Hierarchical Relationship \u00b6 Parent Provider ( parent_id ; not required; string) The parent can be specified by its DEQARINST ID, optionally in numerical form without the prefix DEQARINST . For higher education institutions: if the institution is a faculty or independent unit of another institution, or is part of a grouping of institutions that is also recorded in DEQAR, ETER or OrgReg, you must specify the parent institution. In case the parent institution is not in DEQAR or ETER/OrgReg, a request for adding the parent institution must be submitted too. For other providers: if the provider is part of another provider that offers courses at higher education level, is part of a higher education institution, or is part of a grouping of providers that is also recorded in DEQAR the parent provider should be specified. If the parent provider is not recorded in DEQAR yet, a request for adding that provider must be submitted too. Please note that for DEQAR it is not relevant if the provider is part of a larger grouping that does work in fields other than higher education provision. Such relationships will not be recorded in DEQAR. e.g. DEQARINST4711 Relationship Type ( parent_type ; conditionally required; string) If a parent provider is specified, the type of hierarchical relationship must be classified as one of the following types: ID Type Remarks 1 consortium default type for multi-level institutions or consortia 2 faculty faculty names always appear together with their parent university's name (NB: exceptional case, faculties are normally not recorded) 3 independent faculty or school used if a faculty or department is recorded separately and should appear under its own name only 5 franchise or validation partnership used if a provider offers education leading to a degree/award by another higher education institution e.g. faculty Type of Other Provider \u00b6 Type of Other Provider ( type_provider ; not required; string) Information of relevance only for other providers. The nature of the provider should be marked if known. Four main categories are defined: ID name 1 private company 2 non governmental provider 3 public \u2013 private partnership 4 public provider 5 other Data Source \u00b6 Agency providing information on the provider ( agency_id ; recommended; string) The agency that provides the information should provide its DEQAR ID. The ID can be consulted in the admin interface. e.g. 1 e.g. 73 Source of information on the provider ( source_information ; recommended; string) Link to databases where more information on the organization could be found. e.g. World Higher How to Provide Data \u00b6 If you identify that providers are missing, please send us a spreadsheet with the required data. Before sending data on a new providers, please check carefully that the providers is not yet listed in the reference list of providers . It is important to use the administrative interface to do so, as there are many institutions and few providers recorded in DEQAR for which no reports have been uploaded yet. These are visible in the administrative interface, but not in the public interface; see also the section Finding Existing Providers above. Please supply the providers data using the right template depending on the type of provider: For higher education institutions: Open Document Format (LibreOffice, OpenOffice) Microsoft Excel format For other providers: Open Document Format (LibreOffice, OpenOffice) Microsoft Excel format You may save the spreadsheet in either format or as a CSV file. Send the filled spreadsheet to deqar@eqar.eu ; the EQAR Secretariat will check the list shortly and return the original file with the newly generated DEQARINST IDs added.","title":"Provider Data"},{"location":"institution_data/#provider-data","text":"Each report must be associated with at least one higher education provider.

The primary unit of registration is the university/higher education institution, i.e. an institution of higher learning that awards full recognised academic degrees in diverse disciplines, is organised as central unit and consists of separate functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments). The degree-awarding powers of the institution are recognised by at least one national authority. Functional units (i.e. faculties, institutes, schools, departments) themselves are not registered in DEQAR as separate entities. Reports on functional units are uploaded/recorded/shown under the central unit's record. Reports on consortia consisting of several providers will be showcased in the record of each provider separately. Consortia themselves will not be presented as a central unit. Only in exceptional cases, when the consortium has a long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as an institution itself, will it be registered as a separate institution in DEQAR; such cases are to be discussed with the EQAR Secretariat in advance. Reports on institutions' branches and campuses, home and abroad, will be showcased in the record of the central institution (i.e. the university), while such additional branches/campuses will be shown as further locations of the institution. Only in exceptional cases, where the branch/campus has a proven long-term tradition of organising education and is recognised by stakeholders as a semi-independent institution, will it be registered in DEQAR. Providers that award full recognised degrees through a franchise or validation partnership with a higher education institution, but have no own degree-awarding power, will be recorded as other provider. A hierarchical relationship to the partner higher education institution should be recorded for transparency. In cases when the status of the entity is not clearly determined by the aforementioned cases or the status is debatable, EQAR and the agency will discuss the nature of it taking into account five main indicators: legal status provideral independence financial independence stakeholders\u2019 perceptions local context and approaches to higher education","title":"Defining Higher Education Institutions"},{"location":"institution_data/#defining-other-providers","text":"In DEQAR, \"other provider\" is a provider that delivers content or provides skills training: At higher education level (i.e. EHEA QF level 5 to 8; EQF 5 to 8; EHEA cycle short to third) Does not have a full degree awarding powers (i.e. right to award bachelor, master or PhD degrees) The mode of delivery of the classes, whether the provision is done independently or in partnership with a higher education institution, the ownership of the provider (e.g. private or public provider), the connection to the labour market and the area of study are not defining elements of \"other providers\" in DEQAR.

In case an institution is a legal entity incorporated in country A but formally recognised as higher education institution in system B, the legal seat should be specified in B. In case a higher education institution is formally recognised in several higher education systems, separate provider records should be created, one for each system. For other providers, the legal seat is considered as the country in which the legal entity is incorporated. For providers with multiple seats (e.g. branches), each of the locations (i.e. country and city) could be provided in a separate column with number in the brackets ( [n] ).

Local identifiers are for use by your agency only, whereas other identifiers can be used also by others. Other identifiers may be provided for higher education institutions in OrgReg and must be provided for higher education institutions which are not in OrgReg and for all other providers. For higher education institutions, it is strongly recommended to provide the institution's identifier in the IAU/UNESCO World Higher Education Database (WHED) . Institutions listed in WHED are confirmed to be nationally-recognised higher education institutions. If a WHED identifier is provided the institution is thus accepted automatically. If no WHED identifier is provided, additional proof of the institution's official status is required , see below. EQAR runs a background list of other trusted identifiers presented below.

As the resource tag needs to be used consistently, and the combination of identifier and resource tag needs to be globally unique in DEQAR, it should be communicated with the EQAR secretariat. e.g. DE-HRK Identifier Source ( identifier_source ; conditionally required; string) The agency must provide other identifiers for higher education institutions which are not in OrgReg and for all other providers. The field must be filled in if the identifier is not yet known to EQAR (see table below for trusted identifiers). The source can be a national authority, an international provider or another entity.

We accomplish this through: an easily searchable database of institutions where users can find up-to-date QA reports for download; the provision of a basic set of standardised data on a range of agency activities; linked contextual data on national QA requirements and QA agencies, allowing users to understand the status and nature of QA reports. Download Quick Start Guide Getting Started \u00b6 To get started with DEQAR, it is a good idea to first take measure of your agency\u2019s needs to determine: What to Upload? \u00b6 Take stock of the activities you undertake and the past and current reports which are eligible for DEQAR. Only upload those reports on activities that were confirmed to be within the scope of the ESG when the reports were created. Note: the list of eligible activities can be found on the register record for the agency ( https://www.eqar.eu/register/agencies/ ) and also in the DEQAR administrative interface accessible after the agency activates its account (see below: Activate your Account ). If a new activity is introduced, then a formal change report should be submitted to the EQAR secretariat before the activity is deemed eligible in DEQAR. For other changes to activities, please contact the EQAR secretariat: info@eqar.eu Only upload reports created since the date of the agency\u2019s registration on EQAR (i.e. the date of the first external review of your agency against the ESG). Upload legacy data , i.e. the backlog of reports published since registration with EQAR. Note: if your agency is newly registered, then you should have little if any legacy data. Upload current data , i.e. reports you have recently completed (or will complete in the future). It is necessary to meet certain data requirements in order for reports to be ingested into the system. Data requirements for reports vary depending on the type of activity described. Ensure that you have this data available or can generate it as needed. Note: there are a few \u201csoft requirements\u201d for DEQAR which are not necessary for ingestion but which do trigger a red or yellow alert flag in the system. For details, please see: Report Data Elements Data Pipeline How to Upload? \u00b6 Take stock of the size of your organisation, available staff and technical expertise as well as the volume of activities you undertake. Each agency can choose one (or more) methods for submitting data. The DEQAR team has provided three submission methods tailored to different agencies\u2019 needs: a manual upload for individual reports; CSV file upload for larger batches of reports; and an API which automatically uploads reports from your local database as they are created, individually or in batches. Note: these three methods are interoperable and can be used in different situations by the same agency. You should determine which option or options best suits your agency. For details, please see: Choosing a Submission Method Finding your Legs in DEQAR \u00b6 Once you have figured out what you will submit and how, then it is time to enter the system. Activate your Account \u00b6 Access the DEQAR account for your agency and confirm existing information. To activate your agency\u2019s account, contact the EQAR secretariat at: deqar@eqar.eu Note: unless you wish otherwise, the account information (contact name and email) will be based on the information on the agency already in our system. Enter DEQAR\u2019s Administrative User Interface using the following link: https://admin.deqar.eu Visit your agency\u2019s Profile under My Data: to freely update the DEQAR contact information and password as suits your needs. Note: if you change your email address, you will need to use the new address to reset your password in the future. to update publicly available contact data on your agency, such as agency website, contact person, phone number, address and email. to assign local IDs to agency activities. Note: if you would like to change the general \u201cInformation on the agency\u2019s work\u201d, listed agency activities or the list of countries where the agency\u2019s activities are officially recognised, you should contact the EQAR secretariat: info@eqar.eu You should also analyse DEQAR\u2019s institutional list to ensure that institutions evaluated/accredited by your agency are already present in the system. The institution list can be found on the EQAR Admin Interface at: https://admin.deqar.eu/institutions Note: the base institution list is synchronised daily with the Register of Public Sector Organisations (OrgReg) and the European Tertiary Education Register (ETER) , which cover a large number of European countries. If institutions are missing from the list, please contact the EQAR secretariat: deqar@eqar.eu to arrange for the data to be imported. For details, see Institution Data . Get to Know the System \u00b6 Familiarise yourself with the administrative interface and the Sandbox. Once in the system, you should become familiar with the different modules available to you through the administrative interface: My Data: including records on your uploaded reports as well as your agency's profile (see above); information on alerts and flags. Submit Reports: giving access to the manual and CSV submission methods (see below for API). Reference Data: including records on all agencies, countries, higher education institutions and reports currently in DEQAR. If you are planning to use the submission API, you can use API token found in your agency Profile and the following link: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report The Sandbox is reached through a separate link. The DEQAR Sandbox, like any sandbox, is intended for you to \u201cplay\u201d, enabling you to trial particular submission methods, data structures, formats and syntax. More specifically, it is a space where we encourage (even urge) you to test your submissions before putting them into the live system: To test the manual and CSV submission, go to the Sandbox Administrative Interface at: https://admin.sandbox.deqar.eu/ To test API submission, go to the Sandbox Submission API at: https://backend.sandbox.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/submit/report To see what your records will eventually look like on the public site, go to the Sandbox Public Interface at: https://sandbox.deqar.eu/ Note: the entire data of the live site is copied over to the Sandbox every night. Thus, your login and password are the same as in your DEQAR account\u2014unless you have made changes within the last 24 hours. You can also reset or change your password in the Sandbox, but it will be overwritten by the next day. Perform your First Submission \u00b6 To perform your first submission \u2013 whether through the manual upload, CSV or API \u2013 we strongly encourage every agency to use the test environment, i.e. the Sandbox . Once you do the first test upload through the Sandbox, please check whether the test reports are red flagged by using the filter \u201cFlags\u201d in the section \u201cReports\u201d. Should that be the case, at the bottom of the page, press \u201cShow info\u201d and read the note on the reasons. Please correct your data if applicable (e.g. the status of the report is marked as \"part of the obligatory EQA system\" for a higher education institution with a legal seat outside EHEA, in which case it must be \"voluntary\") or contact the EQAR Secretariat. If the system ingests your files and there are no red flagged reports, please proceed with uploading your reports through the real live environment. In case of doubt, please contact the EQAR secretariat at: deqar@eqar.eu . This will allow us to check your proposed data (particularly if submitted as a CSV), walk you through the submission process one last time and double check your results. DEQAR in the Longer Term \u00b6 Make a Road Map \u00b6 Determine internal priorities and work methods. Legacy data: if applicable, determine a timeframe and method for uploading legacy reports, i.e. reports created since registration with EQAR. As a rule, it is a good idea to use a batch upload method (CSV or API) for legacy data. Current data: set a continuous workflow to ensure that DEQAR is kept up to date with current activities. Determine: at what point in the work process will the reports be uploaded to DEQAR? will the reports be uploaded one-by-one upon completion or in batches, e.g. every month or every quarter? Note: methods for submitting legacy data \u2014 which is generally done in a few large batches \u2014 may be quite distinct from methods for continuous submission. Stay Connected \u00b6 Stick with your road map and adapt your methods as needed. Remember: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Once you commit to using DEQAR, it is important that you stay active so that your agency\u2019s presence in the system is as continuous and coherent as possible. Be sure to load new reports soon after they are ready for publication; otherwise you risk confusing the public, institutions or other agencies. You are encouraged to adapt the method and timing of submissions to best fit your internal work processes. On our side, we have tried to design DEQAR to be as effortless as possible. We hope that the system will prove a boost rather than a burden to your QA work. Note: the DEQAR front end user interface is built using an API. This means that any agency may embed a version of DEQAR (included full search functionality) in its own website to alleviate some of the burden on the local IT team.

If a new activity is introduced, then a formal change report should be submitted to the EQAR secretariat before the activity is deemed eligible in DEQAR. For other changes to activities, please contact the EQAR secretariat: info@eqar.eu Only upload reports created since the date of the agency\u2019s registration on EQAR (i.e. the date of the first external review of your agency against the ESG). Upload legacy data , i.e. the backlog of reports published since registration with EQAR. Note: if your agency is newly registered, then you should have little if any legacy data. Upload current data , i.e. reports you have recently completed (or will complete in the future). It is necessary to meet certain data requirements in order for reports to be ingested into the system. Data requirements for reports vary depending on the type of activity described. Ensure that you have this data available or can generate it as needed. Note: there are a few \u201csoft requirements\u201d for DEQAR which are not necessary for ingestion but which do trigger a red or yellow alert flag in the system.

Deletion of existing records can be requested through the API or manually through the admin interface, but final deletion can only be performed by the EQAR Secretariat. Below we provide a full list of the data elements that can make up a report record. It is important to note that the below list is exhaustive, including all possible elements. Required data elements are listed in bold with a * , conditionally required data elements in bold with a (*). There are several possible one-to-many relations within a report record: e.g. one report might cover several providers (e.g. in case of a joint programme), or several programmes of one institution, or can have several associated files, etc.. In JSON for API submission, these cases can be naturally represented as arrays of objects; in a CSV file, these relations are difficult to represent due to the flat/one-dimensional structure. In the CSV template, such columns or groups of columns can thus be duplicated and indexed with an integer in square brackets, e.g. institution[1].deqar_id , institution[2].deqar_id , \u2026 The structure and field names of the elements below directly reflect the CSV template, with repeatable columns indicated by [n] part of the column name. To see how these elements are arrayed in JSON for API submission, see our JSON definition at: https://backend.deqar.eu/submissionapi/v1/swagger/ Please note that new records for providers not currently represented in DEQAR should be submitted separately beforehand. Please use the dedicated CSV templates described above .

Programme group reports are created for programmes with a similar profile across the entire sector on a 7-year rotating basis. Agency \u00b6 A single creating agency must be clearly identified for each report. The creating agency is often, though not always, the same as the submitting agency (see Agency Identifiers ). When a report is co-created by several EQAR-registered agencies, one of the agencies needs to take responsibility for uploading the report to DEQAR and keeping it up-to-date. This one should be specified as (main) Agency, the other ones as Contributing Agencies. Agency* ( agency ; required; string) The (main) agency which created the report must be provided for each report as an agency acronym or as a DEQAR agency ID. This allows the report to be linked to an existing agency record and makes it possible to validate and transform the submitted data in accordance with the agency's profile. e.g. AAQ e.g. 33 Contributing Agencies ( contributing_agencies[n] ; not required; string) Additional EQAR-registered agencies that were involved in the external QA procedure and the production of the report. Contributing agencies can only be recorded if they were registered in EQAR at the time of issuing of the report ( valid_from date). Otherwise, all validation and flagging rules follow the main agency. The report will also be shown under the contributing agencies\u2019 profiles in DEQAR. e.g. MusiQuE e.g. 34 Report Identifier \u00b6 Each uploaded report is assigned a unique DEQAR report ID. The identifiers of new reports uploaded are shown in the DEQAR admin interface. When using the Submission API, the identifiers are also included in the response object and automatically sent back to the agency via the email tied to the username. Each report can be identified using an agency's local identifiers or through DEQAR report IDs. It is recommended that agencies submit a local report identifier for every report (see Report Identifiers ). DEQAR Report ID ( report_id ; not required; string) A report identifier must be used when submitting updates to an existing report in CSV or JSON. This may be used to submit updates to existing reports or to promote synchronisation with an agency's local system. e.g. 000786 Local Report Identifier ( local_identifier ; not required; string) The report identifier used in the agency's local system should be provided for each report. This may be used to submit updates to existing reports or to promote synchronisation with the agency's local system; the local report identifier is particularly useful in the identification of invalid submission objects. The format and semantics of the local identifier are at the agency's discretion. Please note that local identifiers must be stable and unique (within your agency): if you submit a report with the same local identifier as an existing report of your agency, you will overwrite the existing record. Local identifiers are always linked to a specific agency. Hence, there is no need to include your agency acronym as part of your identifier. e.g. QAA1153-March15 Activity \u00b6 A single activity must be assigned to each report. Activities are selected from the agency's pre-defined list of activities and should be provided as a DEQAR value (as either a string value or a DEQAR activity ID). If you do not find the activity enlisted on DEQAR, please inform EQAR about the new activity through submitting a Substantive Change Report via this form . Optionally an agency may choose to provide local identifiers for its own activities; before these can be used for submission, these identifiers should be assigned through the agency record in the administrative interface (see Role of Standards and Identifiers: Other Identifiers . If both elements are submitted for a single report, then the DEQAR value will be used by the system. Activity(*) ( activity ; conditionally required; string) A DEQAR activity value may be provided as an activity name or DEQAR activity ID for each report. The activity is used to validate the structure of submitted report data. e.g. institutional audit e.g. programme evaluation e.g. 2 e.g. 8 Activity Local Identifier(*) ( activity_local_identifier ; conditionally required; string) A local activity identifier may optionally be provided in place of a DEQAR activity value for each report. The local activity identifier may be used to validate the structure of submitted report data. (Note: local activity identifiers need to be assigned through the administrative interface before they can be used in submission.) e.g. inst_aud Each activity is classified as one of four activity types ( activity_type ). These classifications determine the structure of the report record: Type Provider(s) Programme(s) institutional at least one provider no programme institutional/programme only one provider at least one programme programme only one provider at least one programme joint programme at least two providers at least one programme Details \u00b6 Each report must be assigned a single status and a single decision value. Together these elements signal the role, status and nature of the report. Status and decision values may be provided as either string values or DEQAR IDs. Status* ( status ; required; string) The status must be provided as either a DEQAR status name or a DEQAR status id for each report. The status specifies whether the report is part of the obligatory EQA system in the country of the institution or whether the institution has undertaken it voluntarily: ID name description 1 part of obligatory EQA system A review is of obligatory nature if the QA process/the report/the decision has any kind of official status in the higher education system where the institution is based/established, e.g. further serves for accreditation or licencing of the higher education institution, fulfils a legal obligation to undergo a regular evaluation or audit, etc. 2 voluntary Any other review is of a voluntary nature, e.g. if it is requested at the provider's own initiative and serves enhancement purposes only (i.e. does not lead to a nationally-recognised accreditation or certification of the provider). Where an institution can choose different types of external QA arrangements (e.g. applying for institutional is optional, but might replace all or some programme accreditation obligations), also the optional/voluntarily chosen external QA report should be classified as \"part of obligatory EQA system\" if it has a status within the higher education system's official QA framework. The status \"part of obligatory EQA system\" may only be used for reports that cover at least one higher education institution based in the EHEA. For reports that cover only higher education institutions beyond the EHEA or only other providers, the status must always be \"voluntary\". Type of provider Part of obligatory system Voluntary Higher education institution in the EHEA Yes Yes Higher education institution beyond the EHEA Only if the report also covers at least one institution based in the EHEA Yes Other provider Only if the report also covers at least one institution based in the EHEA Yes The status determines whether a QA report is exported to the accreditation database for European Digital Credentials for Learning (EDC): only reports classified as \"part of obligatory EQA system\" are automatically exported and can be used as accreditations in EDC. See Integrations: EDC for details. Decision* ( decision ; required; string) The decision must be provided as either a DEQAR decision name or a DEQAR decision id for each report. The decision records the final result of the QA procedure/report. The decision should be final. Only in cases when the decision is \u201cpositive with conditions\u201d, the decision can be changed to \u201cpositive\u201d. In such cases, a second report file that confirms the upgraded decision should be added to the record without deleting the initial report file. ID name 1 positive 2 positive with conditions or restrictions 3 negative 4 not applicable Summary ( summary ; not required; string) A textual summary of the key findings of the report/decision that allows users to understand the outcomes without reading the full report. Strongly recommended, the summary should be in English. Comment ( other_comment ; not required; string) The optional comment can contain important information on the report that cannot be represented in the structured data, e.g. involvement of other partner agencies or any specific notes about the QA procedure. e.g. Evaluation undertaken in cooperation with MusiQuE. e.g. Programme group reports are created for programmes with a similar profile across the entire sector on a 7-year rotating basis. Validity \u00b6 Each report must have a date defining the start of its validity. Agencies should also provide a date defining the end of the report's validity. In case the end date is left open, the report will be treated as valid for six years from the start of its validity. DEQAR uses a special notation to denote the date format. This allows each agency to signal the date format it uses; this must be provided for each report. Valid from* ( valid_from ; required; date) A valid from date marking the starting date of the report's validity must be provided for each report. This date is used to generate an archiving date when no valid to date is provided. e.g. 2015-01-15 Valid to ( valid_to ; not required; date) A valid to date marking the ending date of the report's validity should be provided for each report. This date determines when report data will be archived in DEQAR. If no valid to date is assigned, then the report will be treated as valid for six years after the valid from date. e.g. 2020-01-15 Date Format* ( date_format ; required; string) A date format must be provided for each report. Dates may be submitted in any standard format; the format should be represented as a combination of the following characters: symbol(s) meaning example %d day as expressed in two digits 02 %-d day as expressed in one or two digits 2 %m month as expressed in two digits 05 for May %-m month as expressed in one or two digits 5 for May and 12 for December %Y year as expressed in four digits 2014 %y year as expressed in two digits 14 %d-%m-%Y 04-01-2014 %d/%m/%y 04/01/14 %Y-%m-%d 2015-01-15 Files \u00b6 DEQAR requires PDF versions of quality assurance reports for every submission object. Agencies can choose either to make files available for harvest or to upload files. In order to make files available for harvest, agencies must provide the URL for files already available on a public server. Alternatively, files may be submitted using the API or uploaded through the administrative interface. All reports must be submitted with data on the language(s) used in the report. A file display name can be provided as well. ELEMENT NAME REQUIRED ONE/MANY EXAMPLE File Original Location conditionally many http://estudis.aqu.cat/MAD2014_UPC_es.pdf File Display Name no one (per) Report Evaluation MAD2014_UPC_es.pdf Report Language yes many (per) es spa File Original Location(*) ( file[n].original_location ; conditionally required; string) At least one PDF file should be provided with each submitted report in the form of a URL. Optionally, PDF files can be uploaded through the API or user interface. e.g. http://estudis.aqu.cat/MAD2014_UPC_es.pdf The URL should return the HTTP content-type header application/pdf upon a HEAD request. The URL must return application/pdf upon a GET request. If another content-type is reported, the file will not be downloaded and saved. The maximum file size is 10MB. File Display Name ( file[n].display_name ; not required; string) A single file display name may be provided for each PDF report file, used for the file link in DEQAR. If no display name is provided, then the file name will be used for display instead. e.g. Report e.g. Evaluation This should be a short and generic term (such as \u201cReport and Decision\u201d, \u201cEvaluation Report\u201d, \u201cAccreditation Decision\u201d, \u201cSummary report\u201d, ...). The display name should not repeat the name of the provider or programme addressed in the report. Report Language* ( file[n].report_language[n] ; required; string) One or more languages must be provided for each file in the form of an ISO 639 1 (two-digit) or ISO 639 2 (three digit) language code (see ISO 639-1 or ISO 639-2/B format ). e.g. es e.g. spa Link \u00b6 One or more links may be provided to alternative views of the report data on the agency's own website or other webpage(s) in order to provide more context. If one link is provided, it will be displayed with the text \"View record on agency's website\". If several links are provided, display names must be provided for each link. These texts will be displayed on DEQAR in order to distinguish the different links. Link ( link[n] , not required, string) One or more URL links may be provided for each report to the same report presented on other sites in order to provide more context to the report. e.g. http://srv.aneca.es/ListadoTitulos/node/1182321350 Link Display Name ( link_display_name[n] , conditionally required, string) A short text describing where the link points to; required and used only when several links are provided. e.g. report in national qualifications database e.g. decision on ministry's website Provider(s) \u00b6 Each report must be associated with at least one provider. The record(s) for the provider(s) need(s) to already exist in DEQAR, see the previous section on adding missing providers to DEQAR . Preferably, the DEQARINST ID should be provided to identify the provider(s). In addition, the ETER ID can be used for higher education institutions listed in ETER/OrgReg. Alternatively, an agency may choose to use local or other identifiers for the provider(s). Before these can be used for submission, the local identifiers should be provided in bulk to the EQAR secretariat. Only one identifier should be submitted for each provider in the submission object (see Provider Identifiers ). If more than one identifier is submitted, then the DEQARINST ID will be used to establish internal linkage, followed by the ETER ID (for higher education institutions), followed by the local or other identifier. ELEMENT NAME REQUIRED FOR HEI REQUIRED FOR AP ONE/MANY EXAMPLE DEQARINST ID conditionally conditionally one (per) DEQARINST0034 ETER ID conditionally not applicable one (per) BG0001 Institutional Identifier conditionally conditionally one (per) HCERES21 AT0004 Identifier Resource conditionally conditionally one (per) SI-ETER.BAS.NATID Erasmus DEQARINST ID(*) ( institution[n].deqar_id ; conditionally required; string) Each provider already described in DEQAR is assigned a DEQARINST ID. The DEQARINST ID may be used to establish a link between submitted report data and an existing provider record. e.g. DEQARINST0034 ETER ID(*) ( institution[n].eter_id ; conditionally required; string) ( Only applicable to reports on higher education institutions ) Each institution described in OrgReg or ETER is assigned an ETER ID (see Register of Public Sector Organisations - OrgReg or European Tertiary Education Register - ETER ). The ETER ID may be used to establish a link between submitted report data and an ETER record in DEQAR. e.g. BG0001 Provider Identifier(*) ( institution[n].identifier[1] ; conditionally required; string) A local identifier is any identifier used by the Agency to identify a provider, while other identifiers can be recorded in DEQAR for use by all agencies. These may optionally be used in the place of a DEQARINST ID (or ETER ID for higher education institutions) to establish a link between submitted report data and an existing provider record. Local identifiers need to be assigned in bulk through the EQAR secretariat before they can be used in submission; other identifiers can be consulted in the administrative interface and can be assigned in consultation with the EQAR secretariat; see Provider Identifiers for details.) e.g. HCERES21 e.g. AT0004 Identifier Resource(*) ( institution[n].resource[1] ; conditionally required; string) If the identifier you use is not a local identifier of your agency, you need to provide its corresponding resource tag. The value for this field can be consulted through the administrative interface. e.g. DE-HRK e.g. SI-ETER.BAS.NATID e.g. Erasmus Programme Data \u00b6 Information on one or more programmes is required for all reports with the assigned activity types: institutional/programme ; programme ; or joint programme . As a rule, programme information must be entered anew for each report, though DEQAR allows agencies to assign local programme identifiers in order to track reports on the same programme.

Field of study no no one (per) 032 http://data.europa.eu/esco/isced-f/0588 Programme Identification \u00b6 Local Programme Identifier ( programme[n].identifier[1] ; not required; string) One local programme identifier may be provided for each programme associated with the submitted report. Once the identifier has been submitted, the agency can identify reports on the same programme in the system. e.g. 61 e.g. 60800 Programme Name and Qualification \u00b6 Exactly one primary programme name must be provided for each programme associated with the report. The programme name should be accompanied by a qualification title in the same language (information inserted in the Programme qualification field). Agencies may also provide alternative or other language versions of the programme name and/or qualification. The primary name will be used for display. The Programme Name field should only contain information on the name (further details on the qualification, level etc. should be provided in the other fields as presented below). Primary Programme Name(*) ( programme[n].name_primary ; conditionally required; string) Exactly one primary name must be provided for each programme associated with the submitted report. It is recommended to provide the primary program name in English. e.g. Medical Natural Sciences Programme Qualification ( programme[n].qualification_primary ; not required; string) The qualification offered by each programme should be recorded in the same language that is used for primary name. e.g. Master of Medicine e.g. Nano degree in C++ Programme Name Alternative ( programme[n].name_alternative[n] ; not required; string) One or more alternative or other language names may be provided for each programme associated with the submitted report, e.g. in the local language. e.g. Arts-specialist in opleiding Programme Qualification Alternative ( programme[n].qualification_alternative[n] ; not required; string) The qualification offered by each programme may be recorded in the same language that is used for the alternative name version. e.g. Master in de specialistische geneeskunde e.g. Micro-credential in basics in CAD Programme Location \u00b6 Information on the country/ies where each programme is located should be provided only if different from the provider country . Programme Country ( programme[n].country[n] ; not required; string) The one or more countries where the programme is located should be provided if different from the provider's country. The country/ies should be provided in the form of an ISO 3166 alpha2 or ISO 3166 alpha3 country code (see ISO 3166-1 standard ). e.g. BE e.g. BEL Programme Qualification Level \u00b6 Information on the qualification level of each programme must be provided as a standardised level (based on the QF-EHEA levels); agencies may also choose to indicate the NQF level for each programme. Degree outcome* ( programme[n].degree_outcome ; required *; string) The field specifies whether the programme leads to a full degree, recognised by the national authorities where the provider is based at. When a programme report is uploaded solely for an \"other provider\", the value of the field must be \"No\" (= no full degree). If the value is marked as \"yes\", the report upload will be automatically rejected. ID value description 1 Yes Fully recognised degree 2 No No fully recognised degree When a report is shown on the public DEQAR website (as well as in the Web API), three programme types are distinguished based on the degree outcome and workload of the programme: Degree outcome Workload Programme type shown Yes regardless Full recognised degree programme No < 60 ECTS Micro-credential No \u2265 60 ECTS Other provision * This field was recently added to the current DEQAR data model. In order to be backwards-compatible and not to break existing implementations, this field is currently not required, but will become required in the next version of DEQAR APIs (expected in September 2024). The current default is \"yes\" for programmes offered by HEIs, as it is considered as leading to a full degree unless specified otherwise. The current default is \"no\" for programmes offered by other providers, as micro credentials do not lead to a full degree. Programme Qualification Level* ( programme[n].qf_ehea_level ; required *; string) A single standardised qualification level must be provided for each programme in the form of either a level name or level ID. These levels are based on the Framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area (QF-EHEA) , the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) and the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) .

Learner's attendance to the classes is considered as sufficient for obtaining a certificate. 2 Assessment based certificate The course involves an assessment of the acquired knowledge, The learner is awarded a certificate based on their achievements in the assessment(s). 3 No assessment and no certificate No certificate is awarded Learning outcomes - ESCO ( programme[n].learning_outcome[n] ; not required; string) DEQAR uses the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) classification of skills and competences as the preferred and interoperable way to specify the learning outcomes of a programme. A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of an ESCO skill may be provided for each learning outcome. For multiple learning outcomes in the CSV file, copy paste the columns and change the number in the brackets for every next value (i.e. n+1), see above . Validation: DEQAR expects URIs that are valid in ESCO version 1.1.1. Any URIs submitted are validated by making a request to https://ec.europa.eu/esco/api/resource/skill?selectedVersion=v1.1.1&uri=[provided URI] and - if successful - verifying that the object is part of the concept scheme http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills ; agencies may use the same steps to perform internal validation.

This can be complementary to learning outcomes described in terms of ESCO skills, represent a summary of those or be used where the learning outcomes cannot be described in terms of ESCO skills. e.g. Digitise and scan lasts. Work with files in various CAD systems. Produce 3D models of heels and create 2D computer aided designs. Grade and obtain the size series. Prepare technical specifications for manufacturing. Produce 2D and 3D computer aided engineering designs and technical drawings of moulds for vulcanised and injected heels. Export the files of the virtual models to 3D printers, CAM or CNC systems. Field of study ( programme[n].field_study ; not required, string) DEQAR is using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) framework (2013) for assembling the provider of education programmes and related qualifications by levels and fields of education. ESCO uses ISCED-F to organise/categorise the knowledge pillar of skills. A 2-digit (broad field), 3-digit (narrow field) or 4-digit (detailed field) code of the ISCED 2013 classification or a URI from the ESCO taxonomy can be used to indicate the field of study. Validation : a numerical ISCED-F code is first transformed into an ESCO URI by simple prefixing of http://data.europa.eu/esco/isced-f/ . The (submitted or generated) URI is then validated against ESCO version 1.1.1 by making a request to https://ec.europa.eu/esco/api/resource/skill?selectedVersion=v1.1.1&uri=[provided URI] and - if successful - verifying that the object is part of the concept scheme http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/isced-f ; agencies may use the same steps to perform internal validation.

Deletion of existing records can be requested through the API or manually through the admin interface, but final deletion can only be performed by the EQAR Secretariat. Below we provide a full list of the data elements that can make up a report record. It is important to note that the below list is exhaustive, including all possible elements. Required data elements are listed in bold with a * , conditionally required data elements in bold with a (*). There are several possible one-to-many relations within a report record: e.g. one report might cover several providers (e.g. in case of a joint programme), or several programmes of one institution, or can have several associated files, etc.. In JSON for API submission, these cases can be naturally represented as arrays of objects; in a CSV file, these relations are difficult to represent due to the flat/one-dimensional structure. In the CSV template, such columns or groups of columns can thus be duplicated and indexed with an integer in square brackets, e.g. institution[1].deqar_id , institution[2].deqar_id , \u2026 The structure and field names of the elements below directly reflect the CSV template, with repeatable columns indicated by [n] part of the column name.

Any URIs submitted are validated by making a request to https://ec.europa.eu/esco/api/resource/skill?selectedVersion=v1.1.1&uri=[provided URI] and - if successful - verifying that the object is part of the concept scheme http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills ; agencies may use the same steps to perform internal validation. Example of validation logic with http & jq utilities: http \"https://ec.europa.eu/esco/api/resource/skill?selectedVersion=v1.1.1&uri=http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/b1115b14-fa16-4c1e-be6c-91fd49a1808b\" | jq '._links.isInScheme | any(.uri == \"http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/skills\")' At report submission stage, any URI starting with http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/ is accepted; full validation is performed asynchronously. Invalid URIs will be discarded from the database and a corresponding note will appear in the report update log (see Record History in the admin interface after opening a report and clicking Show Info). e.g. Using computer aided design and drawing tools: http://data.europa.eu/esco/skill/b1115b14-fa16-4c1e-be6c-91fd49a1808b Learning outcomes description ( programme[n].learning_outcome_description ; not required; string) Free text field to describe the programme's learning outcomes. This can be complementary to learning outcomes described in terms of ESCO skills, represent a summary of those or be used where the learning outcomes cannot be described in terms of ESCO skills. e.g. Digitise and scan lasts. Work with files in various CAD systems. Produce 3D models of heels and create 2D computer aided designs. Grade and obtain the size series. Prepare technical specifications for manufacturing. Produce 2D and 3D computer aided engineering designs and technical drawings of moulds for vulcanised and injected heels. Export the files of the virtual models to 3D printers, CAM or CNC systems. Field of study ( programme[n].field_study ; not required, string) DEQAR is using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) framework (2013) for assembling the provider of education programmes and related qualifications by levels and fields of education. ESCO uses ISCED-F to organise/categorise the knowledge pillar of skills. A 2-digit (broad field), 3-digit (narrow field) or 4-digit (detailed field) code of the ISCED 2013 classification or a URI from the ESCO taxonomy can be used to indicate the field of study. Validation : a numerical ISCED-F code is first transformed into an ESCO URI by simple prefixing of http://data.europa.eu/esco/isced-f/ . The (submitted or generated) URI is then validated against ESCO version 1.1.1 by making a request to https://ec.europa.eu/esco/api/resource/skill?selectedVersion=v1.1.1&uri=[provided URI] and - if successful - verifying that the object is part of the concept scheme http://data.europa.eu/esco/concept-scheme/isced-f ; agencies may use the same steps to perform internal validation.

Invalid URIs will be discarded from the database and a corresponding note will appear in the report update log (see Record History in the admin interface after opening a report and clicking Show Info). e.g. 032 e.g. 0111 e.g. http://data.europa.eu/esco/isced-f/0588","title":"Programme Details"},{"location":"web_api_auth/","text":"Authentication \u00b6 DEQAR API endpoints manage authentication using API Tokens (through the so-called Bearer Authentication method).
